# RAG-based-Search-Engine

## Retrieval Task
The goal of this project is to develop a query expansion system for a chatbot that retrieves relevant research information from my university's website. The system will allow users to ask natural language questions about labs, professors, and research areas, returning ranked results rather than a single answer. This system will employ a Contextual Concept Expansion (Using Scraped Data) - Hybrid Approach, which is conceptually similar to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. Instead of generating a response, the system will expand the query using contextually relevant terms and concepts extracted from scraped data (professor bios, research topics, lab descriptions). Using transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa, the system will expand queries by identifying semantically similar terms and concepts in the research domain. This approach will enhance the user’s query by making it more comprehensive, ensuring diverse, relevant results are retrieved and ranked, improving research discovery.

## Queries & Search Results Annotation
We will create a set of sample queries related to university research, such as "Who works on deep learning?" or "Which labs focus on renewable energy?", and annotate relevant results by mapping them to professors, labs, and research topics from the scraped website. Each query will be annotated with expanded terms based on our hybrid expansion model. For instance, if the query is about "deep learning," it might be expanded to include related terms like "neural networks," "computer vision," and "AI applications" based on the context provided by the scraped data. The relevance of search results will be determined by how closely they align with the expanded query, considering semantic similarity and coverage of subtopics. This will ensure that expanded queries retrieve a variety of relevant, ranked results.

## System Component Implementation
Our implementation will focus on the query expansion component using the Contextual Concept Expansion (Using Scraped Data) - Hybrid Approach. We will scrape research-related data from the university’s website, such as faculty bios, lab descriptions, research abstracts and research topics, to create a knowledge base for contextual expansion. Using transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa, we will generate contextual embeddings for research terms and use them to expand user queries with related, semantically relevant terms. The hybrid approach will combine scraped data with contextual understanding from pre-trained models to enhance the queries and improve the retrieval process. The focus will be on ensuring that queries retrieve multiple ranked results that are contextually relevant to the original user query. Evaluation will be conducted using Precision@K, Recall@K, and NDCG, assessing how effectively expanded queries improve retrieval accuracy and relevance.
