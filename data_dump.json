He also works with the Soar cognitive architecture, enabling a broad range of artificial intelligence systems endowed with effective and efficient long-term memory. In work with undergraduates, he created CHUCK, a robot that still needs some work, but will eventually beat its creator in a game of cornhole!",

He recently helped invent the Boundary Forest Algorithm, an online instance-based approach for supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as the Three-Weight Algorithm, a general and distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers that has been effectively applied to large-scale problems in robotics, control, protein folding, and multi-dimensional packing. He also works with the Soar cognitive architecture, enabling a broad range of artificial intelligence systems endowed with effective and efficient long-term memory. In work with undergraduates, he created CHUCK, a robot that still needs some work, but will eventually beat its creator in a game of cornhole!",

She holds a BA in Computer Science from Mills College and MS and PhD degrees from the University of California at Santa Barbara. Rollins's research interests include broadening participation in computing, computer science education, and mobile and distributed computing. She contributes to an NSF-funded S-STEM project that awards scholarships to students studying computing at USF. The project implements a suite of community-building activities designed to improve scholars' self-efficacy and develop computing identity. Rollins also co-directed a project that developed system support and user-driven strategies for improving energy efficiency in residential buildings.Rollins has served in a number of service roles. She was chair of the Computer Science department at USF from 2013-2016. She also served on the editorial board of Sigmobile\u2019s GetMobile Magazine from 2014-2018. She has been involved with the discipline-specific Networking Networking Women community since 2010, serving as mentor, fellowship co-chair, and workshop co-chair. She was co-chair of the board of Networking Networking Women from 2016 to 2018.",

He earned his bachelor\u2019s from Brown University and his PhD from Northeastern University. He is broadly interested in the first few years of the curriculum: how we help a person get from no experience with Computer Science or programming to be able to have a productive first co-op. His background is in programming languages, and that influences how he approaches Fundamentals 1 & 2, which are at their core about teaching students how to use the fundamental tool of computer science: the programming language. Patterson is also interested in logic and specification, and how that can enable students to reason more effectively about the programs they write: potentially starting from the second semester, with Logic & Computation.",
