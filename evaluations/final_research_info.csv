Settling the Pass Complexity of Approximate Matchings in Dynamic Graph Streams SODA, 864-904. https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611978322.25","A semi-streaming algorithm in dynamic graph streams processes any n -vertex graph by making one or multiple passes over a stream of insertions and deletions to edges of the graph and using O ( n · polylog( n )) space. Semi-streaming algorithms for dynamic streams were first obtained in the seminal work of Ahn, Guha, and McGregor in 2012, alongside the introduction of the graph sketching technique, which remains the de facto way of designing algorithms in this model and a highly popular technique for designing graph algorithms in general. We settle the pass complexity of approximating maximum matchings in dynamic streams via semistreaming algorithms by improving the state-of-the-art in both upper and lower bounds: • We present a randomized sketching based semi-streaming algorithm for O (1)-approximation of maximum matching in dynamic streams using O (log log n ) passes. The approximation ratio of this algorithm can be improved to (1 + ε ) for any fixed ε > 0 even on weighted graphs using standard techniques. This exponentially improves upon several O (log n ) pass algorithms developed for this problem since the introduction of the dynamic graph streaming model. • We prove that any semi-streaming algorithm (not only sketching based) for O (1)-approximation of maximum matching in dynamic streams requires Ω (log log n ) passes. This presents the first multi-pass lower bound for this problem, which is already also optimal, settling a longstanding open question in this area.",87

While this is subquadratic in n for any fixed є > 0, it gets closer and closer to the trivial Θ( n 2 ) time algorithm that reads the entire input as є is made smaller and smaller.

Our focus is on algorithms that estimate the size of maximum matching after each update while spending a small time. An important question studied extensively is the best approximation achievable via algorithms that only spend poly(log n ) time per update, where n is the number of vertices. The current best bound is a (1/2 + ɛ 0 )- approximation for a small constant ɛ 0 > 0, due to recent works of Behnezhad [SODA’23] (ɛ 0 ~ 0.001) and Bhattacharya, Kiss, Saranurak, Wajc [SODA’23] (ɛ 0 ~ 0.006) who broke the long-standing 1/2-approximation barrier.

In this work, we close this gap. We show that for any fixed ɛ > 0, a (2 — — ɛ) approximation can be maintained in poly(log n ) time per update even in general graphs.

This allows us to obtain non-trivial albeit slight improvements over longstanding bounds for matchings in streaming and dynamic graphs. In particular, we establish the following results for n -vertex graphs: A deterministic single-pass streaming algorithm that finds a (1− o (1))-approximate matching in o ( n 2 ) bits of space. This constitutes the first single-pass algorithm for this problem in sublinear space that improves over the 1/2-approximation of the greedy algorithm. A randomized fully dynamic algorithm that with high probability maintains a (1− o (1))-approximate matching in o ( n ) worst-case update time per each edge insertion or deletion. The algorithm works even against an adaptive adversary. This is the first o ( n ) update-time dynamic algorithm with approximation guarantee arbitrarily close to one. Given the use of regularity lemma, the improvement obtained by our algorithms over trivial bounds is only by some (log * n ) Θ(1) factor. Nevertheless, in each case, they show that the “right” answer to the problem is not what is dictated by the previous bounds. Finally, in the streaming model, we also present a randomized (1− o (1))-approximation algorithm whose space can be upper bounded by the density of certain Ruzsa-Szemerédi (RS) graphs.

We present a single-pass algorithm that obtains a 5-approximation using O(n) space.

Dynamic Algorithms for Maximum Matching Size SODA, 129-162. https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611977554.ch6","We study fully dynamic algorithms for maximum matching. This is a well-studied problem, known to admit several update-time/approximation trade-offs. For instance, it is known how to maintain a 1/2-approximate matching in (poly log n) update time or a 2/3-approximate match­ing in update time, where n is the number of vertices. It has been a long-standing open problem to determine whether either of these bounds can be improved. In this paper, we show that when the goal is to maintain just the size of the matching (and not its edge-set), then these bounds can indeed be improved. First, we give an algorithm that takes (polylog n ) update-time and maintains a .501-approximation (.585-approximation if the graph is bipartite). Second, we give an algorithm that maintains a (2/3 + Ω(1))-approximation in time for bipartite graphs. Our results build on new connections to sublinear time algorithms. In particular, a key tool for both is an algorithm of the author for estimating the size of maximal matchings in Õ ( n ) time [Behnezhad; FOCS 2021]. Our second result also builds on the edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS) of Bernstein and Stein [ICALP'15, SODA'16]. In particular, while it has been known that EDCS may not include a better than 2/3-approximation, we give a new characterization of such tight instances which allows us to break it. We believe this characterization might be of independent interest.",96

This problem has received considerable attention in recent years. The known algorithms naturally exhibit a trade-off between the quality of the matching maintained (i.e., the approximation ratio) and the time needed per update. While several interesting results have been obtained, the optimal behavior of this trade-off remains largely unclear. Our main contribution is a new approach to designing fully dynamic approximate matching algorithms that in a unified manner not only (essentially) recovers all previously known trade-offs that were achieved via very different techniques, but reveals some new ones as well. Specifically, we introduce a generalization of the edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS) of Bernstein and Stein (2015) that we call the hierarchical EDCS (HEDCS). We also present a randomized algorithm for efficiently maintaining an HEDCS. In an m -edge graph with maximum degree Δ, for any integer k ≥ 0 that is essentially the number of levels of the hierarchy in HEDCS, our algorithm takes Õ (min{Δ 1/( k + 1) , m 1/(2 k +2) }) worst-case update-time and maintains an (almost) α ( k )-approximate matching where we show: These bounds recover all previous trade-offs known for dynamic matching in the literature up to logarithmic factors in the update-time. α (2) > .612 for bipartite graphs, and α (2) > .609 for general graphs.

Let G be an arbitrary given graph, p ∊ (0, 1] a parameter of the problem, and let G p be a random subgraph that includes each edge of G independently with probability p . We are unaware of the realization G p , but can learn if an edge e exists in G p by querying it. The goal is to find an approximate minimum vertex cover (MVC) of G p by querying few edges of G non-adaptively. This stochastic setting has been studied extensively for various problems such as minimum spanning trees, matroids, shortest paths, and matchings. To our knowledge, however, no non-trivial bound was known for MVC prior to our work. In this work, we present a: (2 + ∊ )-approximation for general graphs which queries edges per vertex, and a 1.367-approximation for bipartite graphs which queries poly(1/ p ) edges per vertex. Additionally, we show that at the expense of a triple-exponential dependence on p –1 in the number of queries, the approximation ratio can be improved down to (1 + ∊ ) for bipartite graphs. Our techniques also lead to improved bounds for bipartite stochastic matching. We obtain a 0.731-approximation with nearly-linear in 1/ p per-vertex queries.

The optimal algorithm is PSPACE-hard to approximate within some universal constant. We refer to this optimal algorithm, which requires time to think (compute), as a philosopher, and refer to polynomial-time online approximations of the above as philosopher inequalities. The best known philosopher inequality for online matching yields a 0.652-approximation. In contrast, the best possible prophet inequality, or approximation of the optimum offline solution, is 0.5. Our main results are a 0.678-approximate algorithm and a 0.685-approximation for a vertex-weighted special case. Notably, both bounds exceed the 0.666-approximation of the offline optimum obtained by Tang, Wu, and Wu (STOC’22) for the vertex-weighted problem.

Our online allocation algorithm relies on the classic pivotal sampling algorithm (Srinivasan FOCS’01, Gandhi et al. J.ACM’06), along with careful discarding to obtain strong negative correlations between offline nodes, while matching using the highest-value edges. Consequently, the analysis boils down to examining the distribution of a weighted sum X of negatively correlated Bernoulli variables, specifically lower bounding its mass below a threshold, 𝔼[min(1, X )], of possible independent interest.

We focus on designing polynomial time approximation algorithms with respect to the online benchmark, which was first considered by Papadimitriou, Pollner, Saberi, and Wajc [EC'21]. In the vertex arrival version of the problem, the goal is to find an approximate max-weight matching of a given bipartite graph when the vertices in one part of the graph arrive online in a fixed order with independent chances of failure. Whenever a vertex arrives we should decide, irrevocably, whether to match it with one of its unmatched neighbors or leave it unmatched forever. There has been a long line of work designing approximation algorithms for different variants of this problem with respect to the offline benchmark (prophet). Papadimitriou et al., however, propose the alternative online benchmark and show that considering this new benchmark allows them to improve the 0.5 approximation ratio, which is the best ratio achievable with respect to the offline benchmark. They provide a 0.51-approximation algorithm which was later improved to 0.526 by Saberi and Wajc [ICALP'21].

Let G be an arbitrary given graph, p ∊ (0, 1] a parameter of the problem, and let G p be a random subgraph that includes each edge of G independently with probability p . We are unaware of the realization G p , but can learn if an edge e exists in G p by querying it. The goal is to find an approximate minimum vertex cover (MVC) of G p by querying few edges of G non-adaptively. This stochastic setting has been studied extensively for various problems such as minimum spanning trees, matroids, shortest paths, and matchings. To our knowledge, however, no non-trivial bound was known for MVC prior to our work. In this work, we present a: (2 + ∊ )-approximation for general graphs which queries edges per vertex, and a 1.367-approximation for bipartite graphs which queries poly(1/ p ) edges per vertex. Additionally, we show that at the expense of a triple-exponential dependence on p –1 in the number of queries, the approximation ratio can be improved down to (1 + ∊ ) for bipartite graphs. Our techniques also lead to improved bounds for bipartite stochastic matching. We obtain a 0.731-approximation with nearly-linear in 1/ p per-vertex queries. This is the first result to break the prevalent (2/3∼ 0.66)-approximation barrier in the poly(1/ p ) query regime, improving algorithms of [Behnezhad et al ., SODA'19] and [Assadi and Bernstein, SOSA'19].",107

Previous works have analyzed separately how forgetting is affected by either task similarity or overparameterization. In contrast, our paper examines how task similarity and overparameterization jointly affect forgetting in an analyzable model. Specifically, we focus on two-task continual linear regression, where the second task is a random orthogonal transformation of an arbitrary first task (an abstraction of random permutation tasks). We derive an exact analytical expression for the expected forgetting - and uncover a nuanced pattern. In highly overparameterized models, intermediate task similarity causes the most forgetting. However, near the interpolation threshold, forgetting decreases monotonically with the expected task similarity. We validate our findings with linear regression on synthetic data, and with neural networks on established permutation task benchmarks.",110

The convergence guarantees of our algorithms improve over existing adaptive methods and match the optimal non-adaptive algorithms. Additionally, prior works require that the optimization domain is bounded. In this work, we remove this restriction and give algorithms for unbounded domains that are adaptive and universal.

A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size.",128

It is used extensively in geometric settings and in the guise of so-called merge (or compaction) policies in big-data databases such as Google Bigtable and LevelDB (our focus). Previous theoretical work is based on worst-case analyses for uniform inputs — insertions of one item at a time and constant read rate. In practice, merge policies must not only handle batch insertions and varying read/write ratios, they can take advantage of such non-uniformity to reduce cost on a per-input basis. To model this, we initiate the study of data-structure dynamization through the lens of competitive analysis, via two new online set-cover problems. For each, the input is a sequence of disjoint sets of weighted items. The sets are revealed one at a time. The algorithm must respond to each with a set cover that covers all items revealed so far. It obtains the cover incrementally from the previous cover by adding one or more sets and optionally removing existing sets. For each new set the algorithm incurs build cost equal to the weight of the items in the set. In the first problem the objective is to minimize total build cost plus total query cost , where the algorithm incurs a query cost at each time t equal to the current cover size. In the second problem, the objective is to minimize the build cost while keeping the query cost from exceeding k (a given parameter) at any time. We give deterministic online algorithms for both variants, with competitive ratios of Θ(log∗ n ) and k , respectively. The latter ratio is optimal for the second variant.",134

Our focus is on token-forwarding algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing, copying, and forwarding them.

A user should be able to perform keyword searches over all the documents she has access to, including the ones that others shared with her. The contents of the documents, and the search queries, should remain private from the server. This setting was considered by Popa et al. (NSDI '14) who developed a new cryptographic primitive called Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (MKSE), together with an instantiation and an implementation within a system called Mylar, to address this goal. Unfortunately, Grubbs et al. (CCS '16) showed that the proposed MKSE definition fails to provide basic security guarantees, and that the Mylar system is susceptible to simple attacks. Most notably, if a malicious Alice colludes with the server and shares a document with an honest Bob then the privacy of all of Bob's search queries is lost. In this work we revisit the notion of MKSE and propose a new strengthened definition that rules out the above attacks. We then construct MKSE schemes meeting our definition. We first give a simple and efficient construction using only pseudorandom functions. This construction achieves our strong security definition at the cost of increasing the server storage overhead relative to Mylar, essentially replicating the document each time it is shared. We also show that high server storage overhead is not inherent, by giving an alternate (albeit impractical) construction that manages to avoid it using obfuscation. BibTeX Copy to clipboard",143

In this paper, we generalize both of these through a unified framework for strategic classification and introduce the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to capture the PAC-learnability in our general strategic setup. SVC provably generalizes the recent concept of adversarial VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by Cullina et al. (2018). We instantiate our framework for the fundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize: (1) the statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC; (2) it’s computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is always upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension.

The simplicity of these models allows us to explain the performance of attention.We propose an analytically tractable model of query generation, AttEST, that views both products and the query text as vectors embedded in a latent space. We prove (and empirically validate) that the point-wise mutual information (PMI) matrix of the AttEST query text embeddings displays a low-rank behavior analogous to that observed in word embeddings. This low-rank property allows us to derive a loss function that maximizes the mutual information between related queries which is used to train an attention network to learn query embeddings. This AttEST network beats traditional memory-based LSTM architectures by over 20% on F-1 score.

Unfortunately, the costs of distributing this content are largely incurred by web site operators; popular web sites are required to make substantial monetary investments in serving infrastructure or cloud computing resources---or must pay other organizations (e.g., content distribution networks)---to help serve content. Previous approaches to offloading some of the distribution costs onto end users have relied on client-side software or web browser plug-ins, providing poor user incentives and dramatically limiting their scope in practice. In this paper, we present Maygh, a system that builds a content distribution network from client web browsers, without the need for additional plug-ins or client-side software. The result is an organically scalable system that distributes the cost of serving web content across the users of a web site. Through simulations based on real-world access logs from Etsy (a large e-commerce web site that is the 50th most popular web site in the U.S.), microbenchmarks, and a small-scale deployment, we demonstrate that Maygh provides substantial savings to site operators, imposes only modest costs on clients, and can be deployed on the web sites and browsers of today.

Our framework is based on using a private approximate risk minimizer to ""warm start"" another private algorithm for finding stationary points. We use this framework to obtain improved, and sometimes optimal, rates for several classes of non-convex loss functions. First, we obtain improved rates for finding stationary points of smooth non-convex empirical loss functions. Second, we specialize to quasar-convex functions, which generalize star-convex functions and arise in learning dynamical systems and training some neural nets. We achieve the optimal rate for this class. Third, we give an optimal algorithm for finding stationary points of functions satisfying the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition. For example, over-parameterized neural networks often satisfy this condition. Fourth, we provide new state-of-the-art rates for stationary points of non-convex population loss functions. Fifth, we obtain improved rates for non-convex generalized linear models. A modification of our algorithm achieves nearly the same rates for second-order stationary points of functions with Lipschitz Hessian, improving over the previous state-of-the-art for each of the above problems.

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation.",157

Specifically, we characterize this sample complexity up to constant factors in terms of the structure ofPandQand the privacy levelε, and show that this sample complexity is achieved by a certain randomized and clamped variant of the log-likelihood ratio test. Our result is an analogue of the classical Neyman-Pearson lemma in the setting of private hypothesis testing. We also give an application of our result to the private change-point detection.

Specifically, we look at how best to design differentially private protocols in a distributed setting, where each user holds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered two models: the ""central"" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear, which allows greater accuracy; and the ""local"" model, in which users individually randomize their data, and need not trust the server, but accuracy is limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central model without a trusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which limits scalability.In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for distributed differentially private algorithms, which lies between the local and central models. This simple-to-implement model, a special case of the ESA framework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an anonymous channel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum queries, we show that this model provides the power of the central model while avoiding the need to trust a central server and the complexity of cryptographic secure function evaluation. More generally, we give evidence that the power of the shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local models: for a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a widely studied selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity than do central-model protocols.",159

We provide a tight lower bound for some very simple variants of the private selection problem. Our lower bound shows that a sample of sizen=Ω(k−−√logd)is required even to achieve a very minimal accuracy guarantee.Our results are based on an extension of the fingerprinting method to sparse selection problems.

This question was recently studied by Dwork et al., who showed how to answerΩ~(n2)queries efficiently, and also by Hardt and Ullman, who showed that answeringO~(n3)queries is hard. We close the gap between the two bounds and show that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient algorithm that, givennsamples from an unknown distribution, can give valid answers toO(n2)adaptively chosen statistical queries. An implication of our results is that computationally efficient algorithms for answering arbitrary, adaptively chosen statistical queries may as well be differentially private.We obtain our results using a new connection between the problem of answering adaptively chosen statistical queries and a combinatorial object called an interactive fingerprinting code.

This paper considers predicting multiple node labeling functions on graphs simultaneously and revisits this problem from a multitask learning perspective. For a concrete example, consider overlapping community detection: each community membership is a binary node classification task. Due to complex overlapping patterns, we find that negative transfer is prevalent when we apply naive multitask learning to multiple community detection, as task relationships are highly nonlinear across different node labeling. To address the challenge, we develop an algorithm to cluster tasks into groups based on a higher-order task affinity measure. We then fit a multitask model on each task group, resulting in a boosting procedure on top of the baseline model. We estimate the higher-order task affinity measure between two tasks as the prediction loss of one task in the presence of another task and a random subset of other tasks. Then, we use spectral clustering on the affinity score matrix to identify task grouping. We design several speedup techniques to compute the higher-order affinity scores efficiently and show that they can predict negative transfers more accurately than pairwise task affinities. We validate our procedure using various community detection and molecular graph prediction data sets, showing favorable results compared with existing methods. Lastly, we provide a theoretical analysis to show that under a planted block model of tasks on graphs, our affinity scores can provably separate tasks into groups.",189

We investigate generalization properties of fine-tuning to understand the problem of overfitting, which often happens in practice. Previous works have shown that constraining the distance from the initialization of fine-tuning improves generalization. Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation, we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures. For example, on six image classification tasks whose training labels are generated with programmatic labeling, we show a 3.26% accuracy improvement over prior methods.

Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on correlations between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor performance on data groups without these correlations. This is challenging to address when the spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To improve worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training attribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach to directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM models can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a trained ERM model’s outputs to identify samples with the same class but dissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive learning to learn similar representations for these samples. To support CNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a representation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe that worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the alignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class’s worst-group vs. average error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss drastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average absolute lift. CNC is also competitive with oracle methods that require group labels.",191

When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size of the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and ""memorizing"" the training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling---the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text data sets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task.

Sharp Bias-variance Tradeoffs of Hard Parameter Sharing in High-dimensional Linear Regression. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11750.","The problem of learning one task with samples from another task has received much interest recently. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: when is combining data from two tasks better than learning one task alone? Intuitively, the transfer effect from one task to another task depends on dataset shifts such as sample sizes and covariance matrices. However, quantifying such a transfer effect is challenging since we need to compare the risks between joint learning and single-task learning, and the comparative advantage of one over the other depends on the exact kind of dataset shift between both tasks. This paper uses random matrix theory to tackle this challenge in a linear regression setting with two tasks. We give precise asymptotics about the excess risks of some commonly used estimators in the high-dimensional regime, when the sample sizes increase proportionally with the feature dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics is provided as a function of the sample sizes and covariate/model shifts, which can be used to study transfer effects: In a random-effects model, we give conditions to determine positive and negative transfers between learning two tasks versus single-task learning; the conditions reveal intricate relations between dataset shifts and transfer effects. Simulations justify the validity of the asymptotics in finite dimensions.

Abstract The ingrained principles of fairness in a dialogue system’s decision-making process and generated responses are crucial for user engagement, satisfaction, and task achievement. Absence of equitable and inclusive principles can hinder the formation of common ground, which in turn negatively impacts the overall performance of the system. For example, misusing pronouns in a user interaction may cause ambiguity about the intended subject. Yet, there is no comprehensive study of equitable text generation in dialogue. Aptly, in this work, we use theories of computational learning to study this problem. We provide formal definitions of equity in text generation, and further, prove formal connections between learning human-likeness and learning equity: algorithms for improving equity ultimately reduce to algorithms for improving human-likeness (on augmented data). With this insight, we also formulate reasonable conditions under which text generation algorithms can learn to generate equitable text without any modifications to the biased training data on which they learn. To exemplify our theory in practice, we look at a group of algorithms for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game and, using this example, test our theory empirically. Our theory accurately predicts relative-performance of multiple algorithms in generating equitable text as measured by both human and automated evaluation.",201

In this paper, we train a Cross-Modal Coherence Model for text-to-image retrieval task. Our analysis shows that models trained with image–text coherence relations can retrieve images originally paired with target text more often than coherence-agnostic models. We also show via human evaluation that images retrieved by the proposed coherence-aware model are preferred over a coherence-agnostic baseline by a huge margin. Our findings provide insights into the ways that different modalities communicate and the role of coherence relations in capturing commonsense inferences in text and imagery.",202

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return.",203

Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across λ λ -values in an off-policy control task.",206

State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition.

Abstract Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups.",211

In this work we ask: Why and how does this additional training signal help in model distillation? We perform ablations to interrogate this, and report some potentially surprising results. Specifically: (1) Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) realizes consistently better downstream performance -- this means that no student ""reasoning"" is necessary at test time to realize gains. (2) When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements; performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens, for example.

We first study and then discard a supervised approach due to the inadequacy of either content or consumption features for this task and instead propose a novel non-contextual bandit algorithm in the fixed-budget infinitely armed pure-exploration setting. We demonstrate that our algorithm is well suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches. Finally, we study a setting in which users are more likely to stream more-streamed podcasts independent of their general appeal and find that our proposed algorithm is robust to this type of popularity bias.",223

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present an adaptation of RNN sequence models to the problem of multi-label classification for text, where the target is a set of labels, not a sequence. Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task.",225

For very large values of n optimizing over an entire embedding breaks down, so we propose a novel method which first embeds a subset of m << n objects and then embeds the remaining objects independently and in parallel.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.",232

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another.

Moreover, the features that belong to each group, and the important feature groups may vary per sample. But what do we mean by feature redundancy? In this paper, we formally define two types of redundancies using information theory: \textit{Representation} and \textit{Relevant redundancies}. We leverage these redundancies to design a formulation for instance-wise feature group discovery and reveal a theoretical guideline to help discover the appropriate number of groups. We approximate mutual information via a variational lower bound and learn the feature group and selector indicators with Gumbel-Softmax in optimizing our formulation. Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical claims. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and gene expression datasets show that our method discovers feature groups with high classification accuracies.",252

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for each and offer in-depth discussions for future research on hypergraph mining.",266

We prove that the optimization version of this problem is APX-hard but introduce PATHATTACK , a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path.

Recent work has shown that a malicious actor can manipulate a graph to make traffic between two nodes of interest follow their target path. In this paper, we develop a defense against such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose heuristic solutions based on increasing edge weights along target paths in both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum settings. Relaxing some constraints of the original problem, we formulate a linear program for local optimization around a feasible point. We present defense results with both synthetic and real network datasets and show that these methods often reach the lower bound of the defender's cost.",272

We correlate instability with an increase in edge density, and then theoretically show that in the case of Erdös-Rényi graphs embedded with Laplacian Eigenmaps, the best and worst possible embeddings become less distinguishable as density increases. Furthermore, we present the STABLE algorithm, which takes an existing graph embedding algorithm and makes it stable.

The capacity of digital data storage worldwide has doubled every nine months for at least a decade, at twice the rate predicted by Moore’s Law for the growth of computing power during the same period [ 5 ]. This less familiar but noteworthy phenomenon, which we call Storage Law, is among the reasons for the increasing importance and rapid growth of the field of data mining. The aggressive rate of growth of disk storage and the gap between Moore’s Law and Storage Law growth trends represents a very interesting pattern in the state of technology evolution. Our ability to capture and store data has far outpaced our ability to process and utilize it. This growing challenge has produced a phenomenon we call the data tombs, or data stores that are effectively write-only; data is deposited to merely rest in peace, since in all likelihood it will never be accessed again.",276

This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results advise caution when using LLMs to study human behavior or as surrogates or simulations.",277

However, a critical gap remains regarding the role of technology in mediating and enabling communication within today's epistemic communities. This paper addresses this gap by examining how social media platforms and their recommendation algorithms shape the professional visibility and opportunities of researchers from minority groups. Using agent-based simulations, we investigate this question with respect to components of a widely used recommendation algorithm, and uncover three key patterns: First, these algorithms disproportionately harm the professional visibility of researchers from minority groups, creating systemic patterns of exclusion. Second, within these minority groups, the algorithms result in greater visibility for users who more closely resemble the majority group, incentivizing assimilation at the cost of professional invisibility. Third, even for topics that strongly align with minority identities, content created by minority researchers is less visible to the majority than similar content produced by majority users. Importantly, these patterns emerge, even though individual engagement with professional content is independent of group identity. These findings have significant implications for philosophical discussions on epistemic injustice and exclusion, and for policy proposals aimed at addressing these harms. More broadly, they call for a closer examination of the pervasive, but often neglected role of AI and data-driven technologies in shaping today's epistemic communities.",278

Second, we considered incentives -- how do people incorporate a (known) cost structure in the hybrid decision-making setting? -- by varying rewards associated with true positives vs. true negatives.

However, many of the critical domains motivating this work are characterized by competitive marketplaces with many decision makers. Realistically, we might expect only a subset of them to adopt any non-compulsory fairness-conscious policy, a situation that political philosophers call partial compliance. This possibility raises important questions: how does partial compliance and the consequent strategic behavior of decision subjects affect the allocation outcomes? If k% of employers were to voluntarily adopt a fairness-promoting intervention, should we expect k% progress (in aggregate) towards the benefits of universal adoption, or will the dynamics of partial compliance wash out the hoped-for benefits? How might adopting a global (versus local) perspective impact the conclusions of an auditor? In this paper, we propose a simple model of an employment market, leveraging simulation as a tool to explore the impact of both interaction effects and incentive effects on outcomes and auditing metrics. Our key findings are that at equilibrium: (1) partial compliance by k% of employers can result in far less than proportional (k%) progress towards the full compliance outcomes; (2) the gap is more severe when fair employers match global (vs local) statistics; (3) choices of local vs global statistics can paint dramatically different pictures of the performance vis-a-vis fairness desiderata of compliant versus non-compliant employers; (4) partial compliance based on local parity measures can induce extreme segregation.

Unfortunately, many social desiderata concerning consequential decisions, such as justice or fairness, have no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework. In the hopes of mitigating these problems, researchers have proposed a variety of metrics for quantifying deviations from various statistical parities that we might hope to observe in a fair world, offering a variety of algorithms that attempt to satisfy subsets of these parities or to trade off the degree to which they are satisfied against utility. In this paper, we connect this approach to fair machine learning to the literature on ideal and non-ideal methodological approaches in political philosophy. The ideal approach requires positing the principles according to which a just world would operate. In the most straightforward application of ideal theory, one supports a proposed policy by arguing that it closes a discrepancy between the real and ideal worlds. However, by failing to account for the mechanisms by which our non-ideal world arose, the responsibilities of various decision-makers, and the impacts of their actions, naive applications of ideal thinking can lead to misguided policies. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between the recent literature on fair machine learning and the ideal approach in political philosophy, and show that some recently uncovered shortcomings in proposed algorithms reflect broader troubles faced by the ideal approach. We work this analysis through for different formulations of fairness and conclude with a critical discussion of real-world impacts and directions for new research.",284

Precisely, these models align disparate domains into a co-embedding space, achieving impressive zero-shot performance on multi-modal tasks (e.g., image-text retrieval, VQA). However, existing methods often rely on well-prepared data that less frequently contain noise and variability encountered in real-world scenarios, leading to severe performance drops in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This work first comprehensively analyzes the performance drop between in-distribution (ID) and OOD retrieval. Based on empirical observations, we introduce a novel approach, Evidential Language-Image Posterior (ELIP), to achieve robust alignment between web images and semantic knowledge across various OOD cases by leveraging evidential uncertainties. The proposed ELIP can be seamlessly integrated into general image-text contrastive learning frameworks, providing an efficient fine-tuning approach without exacerbating the need for additional data. To validate the effectiveness of ELIP, we systematically design a series of OOD cases (e.g., image distortion, spelling errors, and a combination of both) on two benchmark datasets to mimic noisy data in real-world web applications. Our experimental results demonstrate that ELIP improves the performance and robustness of mainstream pre-trained vision-language models facing OOD samples in image-text retrieval tasks.",291

SkipDiff: Adaptive Skip Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Perceptual Image Super-resolution AAAI, 4017-4025. https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i5.28195","Abstract It is well-known that image quality assessment usually meets with the problem of perception-distortion (p-d) tradeoff. The existing deep image super-resolution (SR) methods either focus on high fidelity with pixel-level objectives or high perception with generative models. The emergence of diffusion model paves a fresh way for image restoration, which has the potential to offer a brand-new solution for p-d trade-off. We experimentally observed that the perceptual quality and distortion change in an opposite direction with the increase of sampling steps. In light of this property, we propose an adaptive skip diffusion model (SkipDiff), which aims to achieve high-fidelity perceptual image SR with fewer sampling steps. Specifically, it decouples the sampling procedure into coarse skip approximation and fine skip refinement stages. A coarse-grained skip diffusion is first performed as a high-fidelity prior to obtaining a latent approximation of the full diffusion. Then, a fine-grained skip diffusion is followed to further refine the latent sample for promoting perception, where the fine time steps are adaptively learned by deep reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, this approach also enables faster sampling of diffusion model through skipping the intermediate denoising process to shorten the effective steps of the computation. Extensive experimental results show that our SkipDiff achieves superior perceptual quality with plausible reconstruction accuracy and a faster sampling speed.",292

Most of these works mainly design elaborate structures to accelerate the inference of the transformer, where all feature tokens are propagated equally. However, they ignore the underlying characteristic of image content, i.e., various image regions have distinct restoration difficulties, especially for large images (2K-8K), failing to achieve adaptive inference. In this work, we propose an adaptive token sparsification transformer (AdaFormer) to speed up the model inference for image SR. Specifically, a texture-relevant sparse attention block with parallel global and local branches is introduced, aiming to integrate informative tokens from the global view instead of only in fixed local windows. Then, an early-exit strategy is designed to progressively halt tokens according to the token importance. To estimate the plausibility of each token, we adopt a lightweight confidence estimator, which is constrained by an uncertainty-guided loss to obtain a binary halting mask about the tokens. Experiments on large images have illustrated that our proposal reduces nearly 90% latency against SwinIR on Test8K, while maintaining a comparable performance.",293

In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

Besides, we enhance the depthwise convolution's performance by adding the input feature to its output.

Existing works on layout representation often ignore element hierarchies, which is an important facet of layouts, and mainly rely on the spatial bounding boxes for feature extraction. This paper proposes a Spatial-Structural Hierarchical Auto-Encoder (SSH-AE) that learns hierarchical representation by treating a hierarchically annotated layout as a tree format. On the one side, we model SSH-AE from both spatial (semantic views) and structural (organization and relationships) perspectives, which are two complementary aspects to represent a layout. On the other side, the semantic/geometric properties are associated at multiple resolutions/granularities, naturally handling complex layouts. Our learned representations are used for effective layout search from both spatial and structural similarity perspectives. We also newly involve the tree-edit distance (TED) as an evaluation metric to construct a comprehensive evaluation protocol for layout similarity assessment, which benefits a systematic and customized layout search. We further present a new dataset of POSTER layouts which we believe will be useful for future layout research.

However, for video action recognition, the action of interest might only exist in arbitrary clips of untrimmed web videos, resulting in high label noises in the temporal space. To address this challenge, we introduce a new method for pre-training video action recognition models using queried web videos. Instead of trying to filter out potential noises, we propose to provide fine-grained supervision signals by defining the concept of Sub-Pseudo Label (SPL). Specifically, SPL spans out a new set of meaningful ""middle ground"" label space constructed by extrapolating the original weak labels during video querying and the prior knowledge distilled from a teacher model. Consequently, SPL provides enriched supervision for video models to learn better representations and improves data utilization efficiency of untrimmed videos. We validate the effectiveness of our method on four video action recognition datasets and a weakly-labeled image dataset. Experiments show that SPL outperforms several existing pre-training strategies and the learned representations lead to competitive results on several benchmarks.",303

To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement.

Generative Enzyme Design Guided by Functionally Important Sites and Small-Molecule Substrates ICML. https://openreview.net/forum?id=ATvN9JnqZ8","Enzymes are genetically encoded biocatalysts capable of accelerating chemical reactions. How can we automatically design functional enzymes? In this paper, we propose EnzyGen, an approach to learn a unified model to design enzymes across all functional families. Our key idea is to generate an enzyme's amino acid sequence and their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates based on functionally important sites and substrates corresponding to a desired catalytic function. These sites are automatically mined from enzyme databases. EnzyGen consists of a novel interleaving network of attention and neighborhood equivariant layers, which captures both long-range correlation in an entire protein sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in 3D space. To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction loss. We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). Experimental results show that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/3463492","Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) is an emerging technique with great potential to support health behavior by providing the right type and amount of support at the right time. A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions. We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.",323

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3448116","Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that ""negated"" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such ""negative"" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers.",324

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3432220","Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-the-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress. There is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions.",325

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two datasets, Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (TACoS), and wet lab, using conventional evaluation measures such as the Jaccard Index and Hamming Loss, as well as a human-subjects study.",326

In this article, we first showcase a user study on how anchoring bias can potentially affect mental model formations when users initially interact with an intelligent system and the role of explanations in addressing this bias. Using a video activity recognition tool in cooking domain, we asked participants to verify whether a set of kitchen policies are being followed, with each policy focusing on a weakness or a strength. We controlled the order of the policies and the presence of explanations to test our hypotheses. Our main finding shows that those who observed system strengths early on were more prone to automation bias and made significantly more errors due to positive first impressions of the system, while they built a more accurate mental model of the system competencies. However, those who encountered weaknesses earlier made significantly fewer errors, since they tended to rely more on themselves, while they also underestimated model competencies due to having a more negative first impression of the model. Motivated by these findings and similar existing work, we formalize and present a conceptual model of user’s past experiences that examine the relations between user’s backgrounds, experiences, and human factors in XAI systems based on usage time.

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques.

Many sources of this data—like code, forum posts, personal websites, and books—are easily attributed to one or a few “users”. In this paper, we ask if it is possible to infer if any of a _user’s_ data was used to train an LLM. Not only would this constitute a breach of privacy, but it would also enable users to detect when their data was used for training. We develop the first effective attacks for _user inference_—at times, with near-perfect success—against LLMs. Our attacks are easy to employ, requiring only black-box access to an LLM and a few samples from the user, which _need not be the ones that were trained on_. We find, both theoretically and empirically, that certain properties make users more susceptible to user inference: being an outlier, having highly correlated examples, and contributing a larger fraction of data. Based on these findings, we identify several methods for mitigating user inference including training with example-level differential privacy, removing within-user duplicate examples, and reducing a user’s contribution to the training data. Though these provide partial mitigation, our work highlights the need to develop methods to fully protect LLMs from user inference.",331

These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel ""one-shot"" approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP training algorithm.

Most MI research focuses on the case of a single standalone model, while production machine-learning platforms often update models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the attacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage of one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to leverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against the original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific ways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions and tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative justification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show that our attacks are effective at using update information to give the adversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also compared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a related machine-unlearning setting. We perform the first measurements of the impact of distribution shift on MI attacks with model updates, and show that a more drastic distribution shift results in significantly higher MI risk than a gradual shift. We also show that our attacks are effective at auditing differentially private fine tuning. We make our code public on Github: https://github.com/stanleykywu/model-updates.

Poisoning attacks against machine learning induce adversarial modification of data used by a machine learning algorithm to selectively change its output when it is deployed. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning attack called a subpopulation attack, which is particularly relevant when datasets are large and diverse. We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat.",340

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation.",341

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",345

However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the output circle-valued maps can be ""geometrically correlated"" even if the chosen cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being chosen by inspection.

This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view, and, as an application, we describe an algorithm which takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation of it in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations, obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction, along the initial global representation.

Medical regulations and the prevailing culture have greatly impacted how ecosystems are structured and stakeholders work together, including whether clinicians and makers collaborate. To better understand these care ecosystems, we interviewed a range of stakeholders from multiple countries, including Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, France, India, Mexico, and the U.S. Our broad analysis allowed us to uncover different working examples of how multiple stakeholders collaborate within these care ecosystems and the main challenges they face. Through our study, we were able to uncover that ecosystems with multi-stakeholder collaborations exist (something prior work had not seen), and these ecosystems showed increased success and impact. We also identified some of the key follow-up practices to reduce device abandonment. Of particular importance are to have ecosystems put in place follow-up practices that integrate formal agreements and compensations for participation (which do not need to be just monetary). We identified that these features helped to ensure multi-stakeholder involvement and ecosystem sustainability.

What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was3.76.But,weestimatedthatcrowdworkersinourstudyspent332.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.",370

One reason for this is that it is difficult for workers to accurately gauge the hourly wages of microtasks, and they consequently end up performing labor with little pay. In general, workers are provided with little information about tasks, and are left to rely on noisy signals, such as textual description of the task or rating of the requester. This study explores various computational methods for predicting the working times (and thus hourly wages) required for tasks based on data collected from other workers completing crowd work. We provide the following contributions. (i) A data collection method for gathering real-world training data on crowd-work tasks and the times required for workers to complete them; (ii) TurkScanner: a machine learning approach that predicts the necessary working time to complete a task (and can thus implicitly provide the expected hourly wage). We collected 9,155 data records using a web browser extension installed by 84 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and explored the challenge of accurately recording working times both automatically and by asking workers. TurkScanner was created using ~ 150 derived features, and was able to predict the hourly wages of 69.6% of all the tested microtasks within a 75% error. Directions for future research include observing the effects of tools on people's working practices, adapting this approach to a requester tool for better price setting, and predicting other elements of work (e.g., the acceptance likelihood and worker task preferences.)",372

While differential privacy (DP) mitigates such risks, it has several limitations in achieving an optimal balance between utility and privacy, include limited resolution in expressing this tradeoff in only a few privacy parameters, and intractable sensitivity calculations that may be necessary to provide tight privacy guarantees. We propose a game-theoretic framework that models privacy protection from MIA as a Bayesian game between a defender and an attacker. In this game, a dataset is the defender's private information, with privacy loss to the defender (which is gain to the attacker) captured in terms of the attacker's ability to infer membership of individuals in the dataset. To address the strategic complexity of this game, we represent the mixed strategy of the defender as a neural network generator which maps a private dataset to its public representation (for example, noisy summary statistics), while the mixed strategy of the attacker is captured by a discriminator which makes membership inference claims. We refer to the resulting computational approach as a general-sum Generative Adversarial Network, which is trained iteratively by alternating generator and discriminator updates akin to conventional GANs. We call the defender's data sharing policy thereby obtained Bayes-Nash Generative Privacy (BNGP). The BNGP strategy avoids sensitivity calculations, supports compositions of correlated mechanisms, is robust to the attacker's heterogeneous preferences over true and false positives, and yields provable differential privacy guarantees, albeit in an idealized setting.",373

However, numerous studies have demonstrated that even sharing summary genomic information exposes individual members of such datasets to a significant privacy risk due to membership inference attacks. While several approaches have emerged that reduce privacy risks by adding noise or reducing the amount of information shared, these typically assume non-adaptive attacks that use likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics. We propose a Bayesian game-theoretic framework for optimal privacy-utility tradeoff in the sharing of genomic summary statistics. Our first contribution is to prove that a very general Bayesian attacker model that anchors our game-theoretic approach is more powerful than the conventional LRT-based threat models in that it induces worse privacy loss for the defender who is modeled as a von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) decision-maker. We show this to be true even when the attacker uses a non-informative subjective prior. Next, we present an analytically tractable approach to compare the Bayesian attacks with arbitrary subjective priors and the Neyman-Pearson optimal LRT attacks under the Gaussian mechanism common in differential privacy frameworks. Finally, we propose an approach for approximating Bayes-Nash equilibria of the game using deep neural network generators to implicitly represent player mixed strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed game-theoretic framework yields both stronger attacks and stronger defense strategies than the state of the art.",375

The computational protocols typically adopted to protect individual privacy include sharing summary statistics, such as allele frequencies, or limiting query responses to the presence/absence of alleles of interest using web-services called Beacons. However, even such limited releases are susceptible to likelihood-ratio-based membership-inference attacks. Several approaches have been proposed to preserve privacy, which either suppress a subset of genomic variants or modify query responses for specific variants (e.g., adding noise, as in differential privacy). However, many of these approaches result in a significant utility loss, either suppressing many variants or adding a substantial amount of noise. In this paper, we introduce optimization-based approaches to explicitly trade off the utility of summary data or Beacon responses and privacy with respect to membership-inference attacks based on likelihood-ratios, combining variant suppression and modification. We consider two attack models. In the first, an attacker applies a likelihood-ratio test to make membership-inference claims. In the second model, an attacker uses a threshold that accounts for the effect of the data release on the separation in scores between individuals in the dataset and those who are not. We further introduce highly scalable approaches for approximately solving the privacy-utility tradeoff problem when information is either in the form of summary statistics or presence/absence queries. Finally, we show that the proposed approaches outperform the state of the art in both utility and privacy through an extensive evaluation with public datasets.",376

At the same time, genomic data has become valuable for reuse beyond their initial point of collection, but privacy concerns often hinder access. Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to such data. These services enable users to query for the presence of a particular minor allele in a dataset, and information helps care providers determine if genomic variation is spurious or has some known clinical indication. However, various studies have shown that this process can leak information regarding if individuals are members of the underlying dataset. There are various approaches to mitigate this vulnerability, but they are limited in that they (1) typically rely on heuristics to add noise to the Beacon responses; (2) offer probabilistic privacy guarantees only, neglecting data utility; and (3) assume a batch setting where all queries arrive at once. In this article, we present a novel algorithmic framework to ensure privacy in a Beacon service setting with a minimal number of query response flips. We represent this problem as one of combinatorial optimization in both the batch setting and the online setting (where queries arrive sequentially). We introduce principled algorithms with both privacy and, in some cases, worst-case utility guarantees.

To promote discovery, collected genomic data is often de-identified and shared, either in public repositories, such as OpenSNP, or with researchers through access-controlled repositories. However, recent studies have suggested that genomic data can be effectively matched to high-resolution three-dimensional face images, which raises a concern that the increasingly ubiquitous public face images can be linked to shared genomic data, thereby re-identifying individuals in the genomic data. While these investigations illustrate the possibility of such an attack, they assume that those performing the linkage have access to extremely well-curated data. Given that this is unlikely to be the case in practice, it calls into question the pragmatic nature of the attack. As such, we systematically study this re-identification risk from two perspectives: first, we investigate how successful such linkage attacks can be when real face images are used, and second, we consider how we can empower individuals to have better control over the associated re-identification risk. We observe that the true risk of re-identification is likely substantially smaller for most individuals than prior literature suggests. In addition, we demonstrate that the addition of a small amount of carefully crafted noise to images can enable a controlled trade-off between re-identification success and the quality of shared images, with risk typically significantly lowered even with noise that is imperceptible to humans.",378

Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks.As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to “distill” LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations.

For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B.

We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts.

To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual “true” diagnoses. We do so with LLMs, to ensure that the input text is from before a confident diagnosis can be made. We use an LLM to retrieve an initial pool of evidence, but then refine this set of evidence according to correlations learned by the model.

Our experiments show that definition augmentation is useful for both open source and closed LLMs. For example, it leads to a relative improvement of 15\% (on average) in GPT-4 performance (F1) across all (six) of our test datasets. We conduct extensive ablations and analyses to demonstrate that our performance improvements stem from adding relevant definitional knowledge. We find that careful prompting strategies also improve LLM performance, allowing them to outperform fine-tuned language models in few-shot settings.

Recent advancements in LLMs offer the potential to automatically generate literature reviews on demand, addressing this issue. However, LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentially misleading) texts by hallucination or omission. In healthcare, this can make LLMs unusable at best and dangerous at worst. We conducted 16 interviews with international systematic review experts to characterize the perceived utility and risks of LLMs in the specific context of medical evidence reviews. Experts indicated that LLMs can assist in the writing process by drafting summaries, generating templates, distilling information, and crosschecking information. They also raised concerns regarding confidently composed but inaccurate LLM outputs and other potential downstream harms, including decreased accountability and proliferation of low-quality reviews. Informed by this qualitative analysis, we identify criteria for rigorous evaluation of biomedical LLMs aligned with domain expert views.",389

This is especially true in the case of MDS for biomedical literature reviews, where models must synthesize contradicting evidence reported across different documents. Prior work has shown that rather than performing the task, models may exploit shortcuts that are difficult to detect using standard n-gram similarity metrics such as ROUGE. Better automated evaluation metrics are needed, but few resources exist to assess metrics when they are proposed. Therefore, we introduce a dataset of human-assessed summary quality facets and pairwise preferences to encourage and support the development of better automated evaluation methods for literature review MDS. We take advantage of community submissions to the Multi-document Summarization for Literature Review (MSLR) shared task to compile a diverse and representative sample of generated summaries. We analyze how automated summarization evaluation metrics correlate with lexical features of generated summaries, to other automated metrics including several we propose in this work, and to aspects of human-assessed summary quality.

Abstract Pretraining multimodal models on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provides a means of learning representations that can transfer to downstream tasks with minimal supervision. Recent multimodal models induce soft local alignments between image regions and sentences. This is of particular interest in the medical domain, where alignments might highlight regions in an image relevant to specific phenomena described in free-text. While past work has suggested that attention “heatmaps” can be interpreted in this manner, there has been little evaluation of such alignments. We compare alignments from a state-of-the-art multimodal (image and text) model for EHR with human annotations that link image regions to sentences. Our main finding is that the text has an often weak or unintuitive influence on attention; alignments do not consistently reflect basic anatomical information. Moreover, synthetic modifications — such as substituting “left” for “right” — do not substantially influence highlights. Simple techniques such as allowing the model to opt out of attending to the image and few-shot finetuning show promise in terms of their ability to improve alignments with very little or no supervision.

Providing more readable but inaccurate versions of texts may in many cases be worse than providing no such access at all. The problem of factual accuracy (and the lack thereof) has received heightened attention in the context of summarization models, but the factuality of automatically simplified texts has not been investigated. We introduce a taxonomy of errors that we use to analyze both references drawn from standard simplification datasets and state-of-the-art model outputs.

Unfortunately, public resources for developing natural language models for this task are scant.

Apparent subgroup performance varies substantially for seeds that yield similar overall performance, although there is no evidence of a trade-off between overall and subgroup performance. However, we also find that the small sample sizes inherent to looking at intersections of minority groups and somewhat rare conditions limit our ability to accurately estimate disparities. Further, we find that jointly optimizing for high overall performance and low disparities does not yield statistically significant improvements. Our results suggest that fairness work using MIMIC-III should carefully account for variations in apparent differences that may arise from stochasticity and small sample sizes.",397

It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data.",410

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.",411

Effective clinical decision-making, including the detection of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and the monitoring of associated symptoms, remains a challenging task for clinicians. This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making.",412

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.",413

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",415

In particular, solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) over manifolds depend critically on the underlying geometry. While graph neural networks have been successfully applied to PDEs, they do not incorporate surface geometry and do not consider local gauge symmetries of the manifold. Alternatively, recent works on gauge equivariant convolutional and attentional architectures on meshes leverage the underlying geometry but underperform in modeling surface PDEs with complex nonlinear dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce a new gauge equivariant architecture using nonlinear message passing. Our novel architecture achieves higher performance than either convolutional or attentional networks on domains with highly complex and nonlinear dynamics. However, similar to the non-mesh case, design trade-offs favor convolutional, attentional, or message passing networks for different tasks; we investigate in which circumstances our message passing method provides the most benefit.",419

It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. Results We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction loss. We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). Experimental results show that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity. These findings demonstrate EnzyGen's superior capability in designing well-folded and effective enzymes binding to specific substrates with high affinities.

To this end, we propose RNAFlow, a flow matching model for protein-conditioned RNA sequence-structure design. Its denoising network integrates an RNA inverse folding model and a pre-trained RosettaFold2NA network for generation of RNA sequences and structures. The integration of inverse folding in the structure denoising process allows us to simplify training by fixing the structure prediction network. We further enhance the inverse folding model by conditioning it on inferred conformational ensembles to model dynamic RNA conformations.

An algorithm for decoy-free false discovery rate estimation in XL-MS/MS proteomics Bioinform., 40, i428-i436. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae233","Motivation Cross-linking tandem mass spectrometry (XL-MS/MS) is an established analytical platform used to determine distance constraints between residues within a protein or from physically interacting proteins, thus improving our understanding of protein structure and function. To aid biological discovery with XL-MS/MS, it is essential that pairs of chemically linked peptides be accurately identified, a process that requires: (i) database search, that creates a ranked list of candidate peptide pairs for each experimental spectrum and (ii) false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, that determines the probability of a false match in a group of top-ranked peptide pairs with scores above a given threshold. Currently, the only available FDR estimation mechanism in XL-MS/MS is the target-decoy approach (TDA). However, despite its simplicity, TDA has both theoretical and practical limitations that impact the estimation accuracy and increase run time over potential decoy-free approaches (DFAs). Results We introduce a novel decoy-free framework for FDR estimation in XL-MS/MS. Our approach relies on multi-sample mixtures of skew normal distributions, where the latent components correspond to the scores of correct peptide pairs (both peptides identified correctly), partially incorrect peptide pairs (one peptide identified correctly, the other incorrectly), and incorrect peptide pairs (both peptides identified incorrectly). To learn these components, we exploit the score distributions of first- and second-ranked peptide-spectrum matches for each experimental spectrum and subsequently estimate FDR using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm with constraints. We evaluate the method on ten datasets and provide evidence that the proposed DFA is theoretically sound and a viable alternative to TDA owing to its good performance in terms of accuracy, variance of estimation, and run time.

Well-estimated class priors are key to accurate approximation of posterior distributions and are necessary for the recovery of true classification performance. While significant progress has been made in the past decade, there remains a need for accurate strategies that scale to big data. Motivated by this need, we propose an intuitive and fast nonparametric algorithm to estimate class proportions. Unlike any of the previous methods, our algorithm uses a sampling strategy to repeatedly (1) draw an example from the set of positives, (2) record the minimum distance to any of the unlabeled examples, and (3) remove the nearest unlabeled example. We show that the point of sharp increase in the recorded distances corresponds to the desired proportion of positives in the unlabeled set and train a deep neural network to identify that point. Our distance-based algorithm is evaluated on forty datasets and compared to all currently available methods. We provide evidence that this new approach results in the most accurate performance and can be readily used on large datasets.",435

We prove that the new metrics are complete and show useful relationships with f-divergences for probability distributions. To further extend our approach to structured objects such as ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution.

Although classification has been extensively studied over the past decades, there remain understudied problems when the training data violate the main statistical assumptions relied upon for accurate learning and model characterization. This particularly holds true in the open world setting where observations of a phenomenon generally guarantee its presence but the absence of such evidence cannot be interpreted as the evidence of its absence. Learning from such data is often referred to as positive-unlabeled learning, a form of semi-supervised learning where all labeled data belong to one (say, positive) class. To improve the best practices in the field, we here study the quality of estimated performance in positive-unlabeled learning in the biomedical domain. We provide evidence that such estimates can be wildly inaccurate, depending on the fraction of positive examples in the unlabeled data and the fraction of negative examples mislabeled as positives in the labeled data. We then present correction methods for four such measures and demonstrate that the knowledge or accurate estimates of class priors in the unlabeled data and noise in the labeled data are sufficient for the recovery of true classification performance. We provide theoretical support as well as empirical evidence for the efficacy of the new performance estimation methods.

Enumerating consistent sub-graphs of directed acyclic graphs: an insight into biomedical ontologies. Bioinformatics (2018) 34(13): i313-i322.","Abstract Motivation: Modern problems of concept annotation associate an object of interest (gene, individual, text document) with a set of interrelated textual descriptors (functions, diseases, topics), often organized in concept hierarchies or ontologies. Most ontology can be seen as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts. Given an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent sub-graph; that is, a sub-graph such that if an object is annotated by a particular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that generalize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large space of possible consistent sub-graphs; however, until now we have not been aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a given ontology. Results: We propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent sub-graphs of DAGs. The algorithm recursively partitions the graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We prove the correctness of this algorithm, propose several practical accelerations, evaluate it on random graphs and then apply it to characterize four major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights into the complexity of concept annotation spaces and its potential influence on the predictability of ontological annotation.

The available methods to assess the impact of these variants rely primarily upon evolutionary conservation with little to no consideration of the structural and functional implications for the protein. They further do not provide information to the user regarding specific molecular alterations potentially causative of disease. Results: To address this, we investigate protein features underlying loss-of-function genetic variation and develop a machine learning method, MutPred-LOF, for the discrimination of pathogenic and tolerated variants that can also generate hypotheses on specific molecular events disrupted by the variant. We investigate a large set of human variants derived from the Human Gene Mutation Database, ClinVar and the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Our prediction method shows an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.85 for all loss-of-function variants and 0.75 for proteins in which both pathogenic and neutral variants have been observed. We applied MutPred-LOF to a set of 1142 de novo vari3ants from neurodevelopmental disorders and find enrichment of pathogenic variants in affected individuals. Overall, our results highlight the potential of computational tools to elucidate causal mechanisms underlying loss of protein function in loss-of-function variants.

We extend the results to a noisy setting where some of the examples labeled positive are in fact negative and show that the correction also requires the knowledge of the proportion of noisy examples in the labeled positives.

We build on this previous work to develop two practical classification algorithms that explicitly model the noise in the positive labels and utilize univariate transforms built on discriminative classifiers.

To this end, many studies have investigated the structural and functional impact of amino acid substitutions. Most of these studies were however limited in scope to either individual molecular functions or were concerned with functional effects (e.g. deleterious vs. neutral) without specifically considering possible molecular alterations. The recent growth of structural, molecular and genetic data presents an opportunity for more comprehensive studies to consider the structural environment of a residue of interest, to hypothesize specific molecular effects of sequence variants and to statistically associate these effects with genetic disease. In this study, we analyzed data sets of disease-causing and putatively neutral human variants mapped to protein 3D structures as part of a systematic study of the loss and gain of various types of functional attribute potentially underlying pathogenic molecular alterations. We first propose a formal model to assess probabilistically function-impacting variants. We then develop an array of structure-based functional residue predictors, evaluate their performance, and use them to quantify the impact of disease-causing amino acid substitutions on catalytic activity, metal binding, macromolecular binding, ligand binding, allosteric regulation and post-translational modifications. We show that our methodology generates actionable biological hypotheses for up to 41% of disease-causing genetic variants mapped to protein structures suggesting that it can be reliably used to guide experimental validation.

Optimal adjustment sets for causal query estimation in partially observed biomolecular networks Bioinform., 39, 494-503. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad270","Causal query estimation in biomolecular networks commonly selects a ‘valid adjustment set’, i.e. a subset of network variables that eliminates the bias of the estimator. A same query may have multiple valid adjustment sets, each with a different variance. When networks are partially observed, current methods use graph-based criteria to find an adjustment set that minimizes asymptotic variance. Unfortunately, many models that share the same graph topology, and therefore same functional dependencies, may differ in the processes that generate the observational data. In these cases, the topology-based criteria fail to distinguish the variances of the adjustment sets. This deficiency can lead to sub-optimal adjustment sets, and to miss-characterization of the effect of the intervention. We propose an approach for deriving ‘optimal adjustment sets’ that takes into account the nature of the data, bias and finite-sample variance of the estimator, and cost. It empirically learns the data generating processes from historical experimental data, and characterizes the properties of the estimators by simulation.

It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. Results We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

While placement exams have been developed in the past, the goal of PSIv1 is to differentiate students who will be successful in a CS1 course and those that would be better served taking a CS0 course as their first computing course. In contrast, traditional placement exams have focused on differentiating students between CS1 and CS2. The PSIv1 is a combination of two instruments, the Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test and the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised Version 2. These two instruments measure students' computation thinking skills and prior programming knowledge respectively. The PSIv1 was administered to all students enrolled in either a CS0 or CS1 during the first two weeks of the semester. We use Item Response Theory to create an argument of validity of the PSIv1 and look at differences in scores on the PSIv1 based on if a student passed or failed a CS0 and CS1 course. We then used the results to create an advising strategy and criteria to help students decided if they should enroll in a CS0 or CS1 course.",451

SIGCSE (1), 360-366. https://doi.org/10.1145/3641554.3701915","Computer science degree requirements often have a rigid pre- and corequisite structure, which can impede a student's progression through a degree and in particular can add one or more semesters to time to completion, particularly for those students who need to retake a course that serves as a prerequisite to other courses and for students who are not calculus-ready when they enter university. In this paper, we present the results of a comparative analysis of curricula before and after a major structural revision. The first curriculum adheres to the conventional, rigid prerequisite structure, while the second emphasizes student choice and multiple pathways through the degree. No changes were made to course content/outcomes between the two versions. Employing curricular metrics such as complexity and centrality, we examine the degree progress of 3010 students over a six-year period. Specifically, our investigation looks at the impact of reducing curricular complexity on student attrition from and attraction to the CS major. The new curriculum, with a 60% reduction in curricular structural complexity, showed both increased retention of students over the old curriculum (67% to 98%) and an increase in the number of students converting from undeclared to computer science (44% to 69%). Our findings demonstrate that reducing curricular complexity need not compromise program rigor and can benefit students by providing greater flexibility and ensuring earlier exposure to (and therefore retention in) CS.",453

Our data was gathered over the span of four years and represents 15,000+ individual applications for all courses in Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Focusing on the dimensions of applicant program level (undergraduate versus Master's students), gender, and international versus domestic student designation, we perform an analysis of application patterns. Our results show that program level, gender, and international status all play roles in student application behavior. Further, we identify specific courses that are preferred by various subsets of students, such as a strong affinity of students who have gone through a Master's bridge program to apply to those courses and a tendency for women and non-binary students to apply at greater rates to our first-year seminar, data science, and databases courses. Finally, we investigate the relationship between instructor gender and applicant gender--revealing that when women and non-binary applicants prefer certain courses, these courses tend to also have a greater-than-average representation of women and non-binary instructors. As a result of this analysis, we present three recommended next steps to gain deeper understanding of the observed patterns. This work demonstrates that with a centralized TA application system, an institution can gain a comprehensive understanding of application behaviors--leading to informed decisions about where to potentially intervene, especially with an eye toward broadening participation in computing at all levels.",454

DOI: 10.1145/3485488","Gradually typed languages allow programmers to mix statically and dynamically typed code, enabling them to incrementally reap the benefits of static typing as they add type annotations to their code. However, this type migration process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper examines the problem of automated type migration: given a dynamic program, infer additional or improved type annotations. Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities. We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the migration to be compatible with unmigrated code. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ""challenge problems."" Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties of gradual type migration. In addition, we apply TypeWhich to a suite of benchmarks for Grift, a programming language based on the GTLC.

The performance of high-level languages depends not only on the underlying performance of WebAssembly, but also on the quality of the generated WebAssembly code. In this paper, we identify several features of high-level languages that current approaches can only compile to WebAssembly by generating complex and inefficient code. We argue that these problems could be addressed if WebAssembly natively supported first-class continuations. We then present Wasm/k, which extends WebAssembly with delimited continuations. Wasm/k introduces no new value types, and thus does not require significant changes to the WebAssembly type system (validation). Wasm/k is safe, even in the presence of foreign function calls (e.g., to and from JavaScript). Finally, Wasm/k is amenable to efficient implementation: we implement Wasm/k as a local change to Wasmtime, an existing WebAssembly JIT. We evaluate Wasm/k by implementing C/k, which adds delimited continuations to C/C++. C/k uses Emscripten and its implementation serves as a case study on how to use Wasm/k in a compiler that targets WebAssembly.

We present two key insights about ASPs for robotics. First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we introduce layered dimension-informed program synthesis (LDIPS) - by reasoning about the physical dimensions of state variables, and dimensional constraints on operators, LDIPS directly synthesizes ASPs in a human-interpretable domain-specific language that is amenable to program repair. We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots.",475

In this paper, we present an approach to introducing computing that allows students to safely and easily program high-performance robots. We develop a platform for students to program RoboCup Small Size League robots using JavaScript. The platform 1) ensures physical safety at several levels of abstraction, 2) allows students to program robots using JavaScript in the browser, without the need to install software, and 3) presents a simplified JavaScript semantics that shields students from confusing language features. We discuss our experience running a week-long workshop using this platform, and analyze over 3,000 student-written program revisions to provide empirical evidence that our approach does help students.",476

Formal Foundations of Serverless Computing. ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA), 2019. Distinguished Paper Award","Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λ Λ , an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λ Λ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λ Λ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λ Λ coincide. Second, we augment λ Λ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λ Λ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work. The latest version of this paper, corrects an error in Definition 4.2 and thus the proof of Theorem 4.3, which were found in the published version. PDF available on arXiv",477

Interactive Robot Transition Repair with SMT. International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-ECAI), 2018","Complex robot behaviors are often structured as state machines, where states encapsulate actions and a transition function switches between states. Since transitions depend on physical parameters, when the environment changes, a roboticist has to painstakingly readjust the parameters to work in the new environment. We present interactive SMT-based Robot Transition Repair* (SRTR): instead of manually adjusting parameters, we ask the roboticist to identify a few instances where the robot is in a wrong state and what the right state should be. An automated analysis of the transition function 1) identifies adjustable parameters, 2) converts the transition function into a system of logical constraints, and 3) formulates the constraints and user-supplied corrections as a MaxSMT problem that yields new parameter values. We show that finds new parameters 1) quickly, 2) with few corrections, and 3) that the parameters generalize to new scenarios. We also show that a SRTR-corrected state machine can outperform a more complex, expert-tuned state machine. PDF available on arXiv",478

Rehearsal: A Configuration Verification Tool for Puppet. ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), 2016","Large-scale data centers and cloud computing have turned system configuration into a challenging problem. Several widely-publicized outages have been blamed not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is that configurations can be non-deterministic. This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations. Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver. Rehearsal then leverages the determinacy analysis to check other important properties, such as idempotency. Finally, we apply Rehearsal to several real-world Puppet configurations.

Existing implementations offer visualizations of algorithms and data structures, but lack the interactivity required for active participation of students. This project aims to foster active learning by allowing students to solve examples through directly selecting, swapping and manipulating nodes and edges of graphs. This game presents a platform for college students to learn and actively practice the Heap data structure, Heapsort algorithm, and minimum weight spanning tree Algorithms such as Kruskal and Prim. Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Three.js, the game incorporates a 3D interactive environment to pilot these concepts. The platform includes two modes: a training mode, allowing penalty-free practice, and a regular mode with a scoring system, a leaderboard and limited lives to foster engagement, challenge and competitiveness with peers. Multiple levels of difficulty, immediate feedback, and a carefully tailored hint system were designed to support stepwise learning and enhance interactive experience. Anonymous Data collection of number of mistakes, time spent and change of score per level, runs in the background without storing identifying information on the students. An interface for instructors allows professors to visualize students' data, track improvement, and analyze students' comprehension and performance.

The workshop consists of 3 groupings of hardware experiments. In one grouping, attendees use breadboarding to construct digital circuits. Transistors and resistors are used to design logic gates; then logic gates are used to design an arithmetic circuit (Half Adder); finally, two Half Adders with an OR gate are cascaded to build a larger adder. In the second grouping, attendees explore the interface between hardware and software, making software concepts tangible. Changing a bit from 0 to 1 in software causes a voltage change on a pin, causing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to light.

Traditional grading systems tend to be too restrictive and hinder a growth mindset. They require strict deadlines that fail to easily account for student accommodations and learning differences. Furthermore, they run into averaging and scaling issues with 59% of a score counting as failing, making it difficult for students to redeem grades even if they later demonstrate mastery of topics. We designed a formative/summative grading system in our CS0 and CS1 classes for both on-campus and online students to support a structured growth mindset. Students can redo formative assignments and are provided flexible deadlines. They demonstrate their mastery in summative assignments. While being inspired by other grading systems, our system works seamlessly with auto-grading tools used in large, structured courses. Despite the flexibility, the courses provided a level of rigor before allowing students to continue onto the next course. Overall, 65% of students resubmitted assignments increasing their scores, participated in ungraded assignments, and used formative assignments for additional practice without a distinction between race or gender. These students went to the traditional follow-on CS2 course and 94% passed compared with 71% who took CS1 with a traditional grading system.",498

However, in spite of the availability of multiple intervention approaches, a key hindrance is reliance on the belief that students know how to study. We dedicated time and resources to not only teach the discipline of Computer Science, but also to teach students how to study using techniques grounded in psychology. We offered a one-credit ""booster"" course to students taking CS 2: Data Structures. Through direct advisor intervention based on the first exam grade, students were encouraged to take the booster course along with traditional interventions. We then tracked student growth across exams for the course as students were learning and being held accountable to study techniques not often emphasized in Computer Science. The students continued to increase their grades throughout the semester relative to the students who chose to not take the booster class. The students who were targeted for intervention but did not take the booster course continued to have lower grades throughout the semester, and only 41% of them passed the course. Students who participated in the booster course showed a 31% rate of growth across the semester, taking a failing grade to a passing grade, with 100% passing the course with a C or above. These results show a significant influence to help students succeed, which led to higher retention and increased grades. If we want students to truly succeed, we must teach them to study.",499

Over the past 60 years about a third of the students either fail or drop out of the course. Past research has focused on improving teaching methods through small changes without changing the overall course structure. The premise of our research is that restructuring the CS 1 course using a Spiral pedagogy based on principles for improving memory and recall can help students learn the information and retain it for future courses. Using the principles of Spacing, Interleaving, Elaboration, Practiced Retrieval, and Reflection, we fundamentally redesigned CS 1 with a complete reordering of topics. We evaluated the newly designed CS 1 by comparing the students with those coming from a traditional offering in terms of (1) CS 1 performance, (2) retention of students between CS 1 and 2, and (3) CS 2 performance. We demonstrate that the Spiral method helped students outperform those who learn via the traditional method by 9% on final exam scores in CS 1. Retention is increased between CS 1 and CS 2 with a 19.2% increase for women, and 9.2% overall. Furthermore, students continue to do better in CS 2 with increased grades across all assessments and show a 15% increase in passing grades. We provide a framework for the Spiral methodology so that others may replicate the design. Our results lead us to consider evaluating and improving the underlying methodology with which we teach Computer Science.",500

CS 0: Culture and Coding SIGCSE, 227-233. https://doi.org/10.1145/3328778.3366795","In 2018, Colorado State University redesigned their CS-0 course to become a general education requirement for the university within Arts and Humanities, and a guaranteed transfer course across the state for a similar category in other universities. The first CS course in the State to be accepted as a GT-Pathway course. This redesign had to be carefully done due to a need to introduce liberal arts style topics such as CS History, Philosophy and Ethics and Inclusive Design issues, while maintaining current coding and student success standards that were already expected for the CS-0 at the university. We termed this combination as Culture and Coding. In order to add more without reducing retention, the course was redesigned around the Psychology of Learning and spacing of topics in a ""Spiral"" Manner. Each topic was briefly introduced, and throughout the semester, students would dive deeper into the topics. This allowed for a 50% reduction of time focused on teaching coding topics, with students performing equivalent on exams compared to previous models of the course that focused 100% of the time on coding topics. Furthermore, students taught by the spiral teaching method outperformed students taught using traditional methods in the follow-on course. Our evaluation suggests that the spiral model of teaching computer science may allow for greater retention of topics, allowing classes to either cover additional concepts or go more in depth on current topics.",501

Our research is based on an initial CS1 course that we divided into a section with students having previous programming experience (P) and two sections for students without (N). Both sections of CS1 were taught with the same curriculum and assessments. We find that the advantages of prior experience are substantial, with P students outscoring N students by more than 6% on exams and 10% on programming quizzes. However, the performance gap between P and N students narrows considerably by the end of the following CS2 course, with no significant difference in overall scores. Analyzing results by gender, our data shows that 22% of N students in CS1 are female versus only 12% of P students. However, the female students with prior exposure outperform their male peers in all areas. Another finding of our research is the confirmation of a significant difference in confidence between female and male students.",502

Our data was gathered over the span of four years and represents 15,000+ individual applications for all courses in Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Focusing on the dimensions of applicant program level (undergraduate versus Master's students), gender, and international versus domestic student designation, we perform an analysis of application patterns. Our results show that program level, gender, and international status all play roles in student application behavior. Further, we identify specific courses that are preferred by various subsets of students, such as a strong affinity of students who have gone through a Master's bridge program to apply to those courses and a tendency for women and non-binary students to apply at greater rates to our first-year seminar, data science, and databases courses. Finally, we investigate the relationship between instructor gender and applicant gender--revealing that when women and non-binary applicants prefer certain courses, these courses tend to also have a greater-than-average representation of women and non-binary instructors. As a result of this analysis, we present three recommended next steps to gain deeper understanding of the observed patterns. This work demonstrates that with a centralized TA application system, an institution can gain a comprehensive understanding of application behaviors--leading to informed decisions about where to potentially intervene, especially with an eye toward broadening participation in computing at all levels.",503

Students could receive full credit for a homework assignment even if it was incomplete, making office hours less hectic. Students could also submit their homework after working on it for a certain number of hours, even if a bug still existed. Our ungrading policy also helped our TAs feel valued.

Second, that it is vital the curriculum is designed based on peer-to-peer learning and actively incorporates abstract pedagogical reflection into the materials. When TAs are taught the content, it is grounded in the same techniques that we are encouraging them to use and that, as computing faculty, we ourselves use.

To test the continuous authentication performance of the proposed method, we conducted two sets of analyses. We built a virtual reality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive) and haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a real teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then conducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by using the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The performance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time) operator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated impersonation attack.

We also find that Amazon processes smart speaker interaction data to infer user interests and uses those inferences to serve targeted ads to users. Smart speaker interaction also leads to ad targeting and as much as 30X higher bids in ad auctions, from third party advertisers. Finally, we find that Amazon's and third party skills' data practices are often not clearly disclosed in their policy documents.",518

In this paper, we present a comprehensive and empirical measurement study to shed light on the local communication within a smart home deployment and its threats. We use a unique combination of passive network traffic captures, protocol honeypots, dynamic mobile app analysis, and crowdsourced IoT data from participants to identify and analyze a wide range of device activities on the local network. We then analyze these datasets to characterize local network protocols, security and privacy threats associated with them. Our analysis reveals vulnerable devices, insecure use of network protocols, and sensitive data exposure by IoT devices. We provide evidence of how this information is exfiltrated to remote servers by mobile apps and third-party SDKs, potentially for household fingerprinting, surveillance and cross-device tracking. We make our datasets and analysis publicly available to support further research in this area.",519

In this work, we study a large number of TLS-enabled consumer IoT devices to shed light on how effectively they use TLS, in terms of establishing secure connections and correctly validating certificates, and how observed behavior changes over time. To this end, we gather more than two years of TLS network traffic from IoT devices, conduct active probing to test for vulnerabilities, and develop a novel blackbox technique for exploring the trusted root stores in IoT devices by exploiting a side-channel through TLS Alert Messages. We find a wide range of behaviors across devices, with some adopting best security practices but most being vulnerable in one or more of the following ways: use of old/insecure protocol versions and/or ciphersuites, lack of certificate validation, and poor maintenance of root stores. Specifically, we find that at least 8 IoT devices still include distrusted certificates in their root stores, 11/32 devices are vulnerable to TLS interception attacks, and that many devices fail to adopt modern protocol features over time. Our findings motivate the need for IoT manufacturers to audit, upgrade, and maintain their devices' TLS implementations in a consistent and uniform way that safeguards all of their network traffic.",521

We establish epistemic autonomy by applying the transfeminine principle of autonomy to the problem of epistemic injustice. To articulate the harm of violating one's epistemic autonomy, we present six stories from two trans women: (1) a transfem online administrator and (2) a transfem researcher. We then synthesize our definition of epistemic autonomy in research into a research paradigm. Finally, we present two variants of common HCI methods, autoethnography and asynchronous remote communities, that stem from these beliefs. We discuss how CHI is uniquely situated to champion this paradigm and, thereby, the epistemic autonomy of our research participants.",523

While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional, often non-Western, ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards epistemic justice.

However, the efficacy of this strategy in limiting the delivery of harmful content to users is not well understood. In this paper, we create a framework to quantify the efficacy of content moderation and use our metrics to analyze content removal on Facebook within the U.S. news ecosystem. In a data set of over 2M posts with 1.6B user engagements collected from 2,551 U.S. news sources before and during the Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021, we identify 10,811 removed posts. We find that the active engagement life cycle of Facebook posts is very short, with 90% of all engagement occurring within the first 30 hours after posting. Thus, even relatively quick intervention allowed significant accrual of engagement before removal, and prevented only 21% of the predicted engagement potential during a baseline period before the U.S. Capitol attack. Nearly a week after the attack, Facebook began removing older content, but these removals occurred so late in these posts' engagement life cycles that they disrupted less than 1% of predicted future engagement, highlighting the limited impact of this intervention. Content moderation likely has limits in its ability to prevent engagement, especially in a crisis, and we recommend that other approaches such as slowing down the rate of content diffusion be investigated.",527

In this paper, we quantify whether Facebook’s current enforcement correctly identifies political ads and ensures compliance by advertisers. In a comprehensive, large-scale analysis of 4.2 million political and 29.6 million non-political ads from 215,030 advertisers, we identify ads correctly detected as political (true positives), ads incorrectly detected (false positives), and ads missed by detection (false negatives). Facebook’s current enforcement appears imprecise: 61% more ads are missed than are detected worldwide, and 55% of U.S. detected ads are in fact non-political. Detection performance is uneven across countries, with some having up to 53 times higher false negative rates among clearly political pages than in the U.S. Moreover, enforcement appears inadequate for preventing systematic violations of political advertising policies: for example, advertisers were able to continue running political ads without disclosing them while they were temporarily prohibited in the U.S. We attribute these flaws to five gaps in Facebook’s current enforcement and transparency implementation, and close with recommendations to improve the security of the online political ad ecosystem.

Learning Flexible Heterogeneous Coordination with Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks CoRR, abs/2501.06058. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.06058","Recent advances have enabled heterogeneous multi-robot teams to learn complex and effective coordination. However, existing architectural designs that support heterogeneous teams tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Some attempt to encode diverse behaviors within a single shared architecture by appending the input with an ID unique to each robot or robot type. These designs improve sample and parameter efficiency but tend to limit behavioral diversity. Others use a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. We view these two designs as ends of a spectrum and explore a middle-ground approach that enables efficient learning of diverse behaviors. Inspired by work in transfer learning and meta RL, and building upon prior work in trait-based task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a general-purpose soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to enable a single architecture to dynamically adapt to each robot and the current context. Intuitively, CASH encodes shared decision making strategies that can be adapted to each robot based on local observations and the robots' individual and collective capabilities (e.g., speed and payload). CASH explicitly captures the impact of capabilities on collective behavior, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. We conducted experiments across four heterogeneous coordination tasks and three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL) using SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, CASH generates appropriately diverse behaviors and outperforms baseline architectures in task performance and sample efficiency during training and zero-shot generalization while utilizing 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.",529

By emitting deliberately designed acoustic signals, an adversary can control the output of an inertial sensor, which triggers unnecessary motion compensation and results in a blurred image. These blurred images can induce object misclassification, affecting safety-critical decision-making. We model the feasibility of such acoustic manipulation and design an attack framework that can accomplish three types of attacks.",530

Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs.

One well-known instance of these attacks is the widespread use of trick banners that use social engineering techniques to lure victims into clicking on deceptive fake links, potentially leading to a malicious domain or malware. A recent and pervasive trend by attackers is to imitate the ""download"" or ""play"" buttons in popular file sharing sites (e.g., one-click hosters, video-streaming sites, bittorrent sites) in an attempt to trick users into clicking on these fake banners instead of the genuine link. In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically assisting Internet users in detecting malicious trick banners and helping them identify the correct link. We present a set of features to characterize trick banners based on their visual properties such as image size, color, placement on the enclosing webpage, whether they contain animation effects, and whether they consistently appear with the same visual properties on consecutive loads of the same webpage. We have implemented a tool called TrueClick, which uses image processing and machine learning techniques to build a classifier based on these features to automatically detect the trick banners on a webpage. Our approach automatically classifies trick banners, and requires no manual effort to compile blacklists as current approaches do. Our experiments show that TrueClick results in a 3.55 factor improvement in correct link selection in the absence of other ad blocking software, and that it can detect trick banners missed by a popular ad detection tool, Adblock Plus.",541

Prior studies have examined moderation tools and practices, moderation challenges, and the emotional labor and burnout of volunteer moderators. However, researchers have yet to delve into the ways moderators support one another in combating hate and harassment within the communities they moderate through participation in meta-communities of moderators. To address this gap, we have conducted a qualitative content analysis of 115 hate and harassment-related threads from r/ModSupport and r/modhelp, two major subreddit forums for moderators for this type of mutual support. Our study reveals that moderators seek assistance on topics ranging from fighting attacks to understanding Reddit policies and rules to just venting their frustration.

We identify potentially misunderstood technical terms that appear in privacy policies through a survey of current privacy policies and a pilot user study. We then run a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate whether users can accurately define these technical terms, to identify commonly held misconceptions, and to investigate how the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with privacy policies. We find that technical terms are broadly misunderstood and that particular misconceptions are common. We also find that the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with various privacy policies and their reported likeliness to accept those policies. We conclude that current use of technical terms in privacy policies poses a challenge to policy transparency and user privacy, and that companies should take steps to mitigate this effect.

Over the years, informal conventions or ""norms"" for transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based on their offered ""transaction fee-per-byte."" Bitcoin users are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels.

In turn, large-scale content providers are forced to use staggering numbers of addresses, ultimately leading to address exhaustion (IPv4) and inefficiency (IPv6). In this paper, we revisit IP bindings, entirely. We attempt to evolve addressing conventions by decoupling IP in DNS and from network sockets. Alongside technologies such as SNI and ECMP, a new architecture emerges that ``unbinds'' IP from services and servers, thereby returning IP's role to merely that of reachability. The architecture is under evaluation at a major CDN in multiple datacenters. We show that addresses can be generated randomly \emph{per-query}, for 20M+ domains and services, from as few as ~4K addresses, 256 addresses, and even \emph{one} IP address. We explain why this approach is transparent to routing, L4/L7 load-balancers, distributed caching, and all surrounding systems -- and is \emph{highly desirable}.

In this paper we outline a framework for algorithmic auditing by way of a case-study of pymetrics, a startup that uses machine learning to recommend job candidates to their clients.

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first system and mobile app for identifying traffic differentiation for arbitrary applications in the mobile environment (i.e., wireless networks such as cellular and WiFi, used by smartphones and tablets). The key idea is to use a VPN proxy to record and replay the network traffic generated by arbitrary applications, and compare it with the network behavior when replaying this traffic outside of an encrypted tunnel. We perform the first known testbed experiments with actual commercial shaping devices to validate our system design and demonstrate how it outperforms previous work for detecting differentiation.

Administrators can define intents that capture the overall behavior they want from the network, and an IBN controller compiles such intents into low-level configurations that get installed in the network and implement the desired behavior. We discovered that current IBN specifications and implementations do not specify that flow rule installation orderings should be enforced, which leads to temporal vulnerabilities where, for a limited time, attackers can exploit indeterminate connectivity behavior to gain unauthorized network access. In this paper, we analyze the causes of such temporal vulnerabilities and their security impacts with a representative case study via the ONOS IBN implementation. We devise the Phantom Link attack and demonstrate a working exploit to highlight the security impacts. To defend against such attacks, we propose Spotlight, a detection method that can alert a system administrator of risky intent updates prone to exploitable temporal vulnerabilities. Spotlight is effective in identifying risky updates using realistic network topologies and policies. We show that Spotlight can detect risky updates in a mean time of 0.65 seconds for topologies of over 1,300 nodes.",561

There are multiple Lightning Network client implementations, all of which conform to the same textual specifications known as BOLTs. Several vulnerabilities have been manually discovered, but to-date there have been few works systematically analyzing the security of the Lightning Network. In this work, we take a foundational approach to analyzing the security of the Lightning Network with the help of formal methods. Based on the BOLTs' specifications, we build a detailed formal model of the Lightning Network's single-hop payment protocol and verify it using the Spin model checker. Our model captures both concurrency and error semantics of the payment protocol. We then define several security properties which capture the correct intermediate operation of the protocol, ensuring that the outcome is always certain to both channel peers, and using them we re-discover a known attack previously reported in the literature along with a novel attack, referred to as a Payout Race. A Payout Race consists of a particular sequence of events that can lead to an ambiguity in the protocol in which innocent users can unwittingly lose funds. We confirm the practicality of this attack by reproducing it in a local testbed environment.",562

Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks.",563

We present a class of SDN control plane integrity attacks that we call cross-app poisoning (CAP), in which an unprivileged app manipulates the shared control plane state to trick a privileged app into taking actions on its behalf. We demonstrate how role-based access control (RBAC) schemes are insufficient for preventing such attacks because they neither track information flow nor enforce information flow control (IFC). We also present a defense, ProvSDN, that uses data provenance to track information flow and serves as an online reference monitor to prevent CAP attacks.

Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit.

Many sources of this data—like code, forum posts, personal websites, and books—are easily attributed to one or a few “users”. In this paper, we ask if it is possible to infer if any of a _user’s_ data was used to train an LLM. Not only would this constitute a breach of privacy, but it would also enable users to detect when their data was used for training. We develop the first effective attacks for _user inference_—at times, with near-perfect success—against LLMs. Our attacks are easy to employ, requiring only black-box access to an LLM and a few samples from the user, which _need not be the ones that were trained on_. We find, both theoretically and empirically, that certain properties make users more susceptible to user inference: being an outlier, having highly correlated examples, and contributing a larger fraction of data. Based on these findings, we identify several methods for mitigating user inference including training with example-level differential privacy, removing within-user duplicate examples, and reducing a user’s contribution to the training data. Though these provide partial mitigation, our work highlights the need to develop methods to fully protect LLMs from user inference.",571

These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel ""one-shot"" approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP training algorithm.

Most MI research focuses on the case of a single standalone model, while production machine-learning platforms often update models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the attacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage of one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to leverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against the original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific ways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions and tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative justification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show that our attacks are effective at using update information to give the adversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also compared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a related machine-unlearning setting. We perform the first measurements of the impact of distribution shift on MI attacks with model updates, and show that a more drastic distribution shift results in significantly higher MI risk than a gradual shift. We also show that our attacks are effective at auditing differentially private fine tuning. We make our code public on Github: https://github.com/stanleykywu/model-updates.

Poisoning attacks against machine learning induce adversarial modification of data used by a machine learning algorithm to selectively change its output when it is deployed. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning attack called a subpopulation attack, which is particularly relevant when datasets are large and diverse. We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat.",580

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation.",581

Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2021.","Closely monitoring the behavior of a software system during its execution enables developers and analysts to observe, and ultimately understand, how it works. This kind of dynamic analysis can be instrumental to reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and debugging. While these analyses are typically well-supported for homogeneous desktop platforms (e.g., x86 desktop PCs), they can rarely be applied in the heterogeneous world of embedded systems. One approach to enable dynamic analyses of embedded systems is to move software stacks from physical systems into virtual environments that sufficiently model hardware behavior. This process which we call ""rehosting"" poses a significant research challenge with major implications for security analyses. Although rehosting has traditionally been an unscientific and ad-hoc endeavor undertaken by domain experts with varying time and resources at their disposal, researchers are beginning to address rehosting challenges systematically and in earnest. In this paper, we establish that emulation is insufficient to conduct large-scale dynamic analysis of real-world hardware systems and present rehosting as a firmware-centric alternative. Furthermore, we taxonomize preliminary rehosting efforts, identify the fundamental components of the rehosting process, and propose directions for future research.",584

One reason for this is the paucity of ground truth: bugs in real programs with known root causes and triggering inputs are difficult to collect at a meaningful scale. Bug injection technologies that add synthetic bugs into real programs seem to offer a solution, but the differences in finding these synthetic bugs versus organic bugs have not previously been explored at a large scale. Using over 80 years of CPU time, we ran eight fuzzers across 20 targets from the Rode0day bug-finding competition and the LAVA-M corpus. Experiments were standardized with respect to compute resources and metrics gathered. These experiments show differences in fuzzer performance as well as the impact of various configuration options. For instance, it is clear that integrating symbolic execution with mutational fuzzing is very effective and that using dictionaries improves performance. Other conclusions are less clear-cut; for example, no one fuzzer beat all others on all tests. It is noteworthy that no fuzzer found any organic bugs (i.e., one reported in a CVE), despite 50 such bugs being available for discovery in the fuzzing corpus. A close analysis of results revealed a possible explanation: a dramatic difference between where synthetic and organic bugs live with respect to the ""main path"" discovered by fuzzers. We find that recent updates to bug injection systems have made synthetic bugs more difficult to discover, but they are still significantly easier to find than organic bugs in our target programs. Finally, this study identifies flaws in bug injection techniques and suggests a number of axes along which synthetic bugs should be improved.",585

Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.",586

One well-understood threat to privacy for such applications is the leakage of sensitive user information either in transit or at the server. In response, an array of defensive techniques have been developed to identify or block unintended or malicious information leakage. However, prior work has primarily considered privacy leaks originating at the client directed at the server, while leakage in the reverse direction -- from the server to the client -- is comparatively under-studied. The question of whether and to what degree this leakage constitutes a threat remains an open question. We answer this question in the affirmative with Hush, a technique for semi-automatically identifying Server-based InFormation OvershariNg (SIFON) vulnerabilities in multi-tier applications. In particular, the technique detects SIFON vulnerabilities using a heuristic that overshared sensitive information from server-side APIs will not be displayed by the application's user interface. The technique first performs a scalable static program analysis to screen applications for potential vulnerabilities, and then attempts to confirm these candidates as true vulnerabilities with a partially-automated dynamic analysis. Our evaluation over a large corpus of Android applications demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique by discovering several previously-unknown SIFON vulnerabilities in eight applications.",587

""A better method to analyze blockchain consistency."" Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2018.","The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol. To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous. The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains: Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider; We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols; We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction ""confirmed""; We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system; We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore ""balancing""-attack. In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages.

Public Key Cryptography (1) 2018: 95-124","Ariel Hamlin, abhi shelat, Mor Weiss, and Daniel Wichs We consider a setting where users store their encrypted documents on a remote server and can selectively share documents with each other. A user should be able to perform keyword searches over all the documents she has access to, including the ones that others shared with her. The contents of the documents, and the search queries, should remain private from the server. This setting was considered by Popa et al. (NSDI '14) who developed a new cryptographic primitive called Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (MKSE), together with an instantiation and an implementation within a system called Mylar, to address this goal. Unfortunately, Grubbs et al. (CCS '16) showed that the proposed MKSE definition fails to provide basic security guarantees, and that the Mylar system is susceptible to simple attacks. Most notably, if a malicious Alice colludes with the server and shares a document with an honest Bob then the privacy of all of Bob's search queries is lost. In this work we revisit the notion of MKSE and propose a new strengthened definition that rules out the above attacks. We then construct MKSE schemes meeting our definition. We first give a simple and efficient construction using only pseudorandom functions. This construction achieves our strong security definition at the cost of increasing the server storage overhead relative to Mylar, essentially replicating the document each time it is shared. We also show that high server storage overhead is not inherent, by giving an alternate (albeit impractical) construction that manages to avoid it using obfuscation. BibTeX Copy to clipboard",595

However, auditing a black-box system for bias can be challenging due to the lack of transparency in the model's internal workings. In many web applications, such as Yelp, it is challenging, if not impossible, to manipulate their inputs systematically to identify bias in the output. Yelp connects users and businesses, where users identify new businesses and simultaneously express their experiences through reviews. Yelp recommendation software moderates user-provided content by categorizing it into recommended and not-recommended sections. The recommended reviews, among other attributes, are used by Yelp's ranking algorithm to rank businesses in a neighborhood. Due to Yelp's substantial popularity and its high impact on local businesses' success, understanding the bias of its algorithms is crucial.This data-driven study, for the first time, investigates the bias of Yelp's business ranking and review recommendation system. We examine three hypotheses to assess if Yelp's recommendation software shows bias against reviews of less established users with fewer friends and reviews and if Yelp's business ranking algorithm shows bias against restaurants located in specific neighborhoods, particularly in hotspot regions, with specific demographic compositions. Our findings show that reviews of less-established users are disproportionately categorized as not-recommended. We also find a positive association between restaurants' location in hotspot regions and their average exposure. Furthermore, we observed some cases of severe disparity bias in cities where the hotspots are in neighborhoods with less demographic diversity or higher affluence and education levels.",597

For example, over-parameterized neural networks often satisfy this condition. Fourth, we provide new state-of-the-art rates for stationary points of non-convex population loss functions. Fifth, we obtain improved rates for non-convex generalized linear models. A modification of our algorithm achieves nearly the same rates for second-order stationary points of functions with Lipschitz Hessian, improving over the previous state-of-the-art for each of the above problems.

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation.",610

ArXiv, abs/1811.11148.","Hypothesis testing plays a central role in statistical inference, and is used in many settings where privacy concerns are paramount. This work answers a basic question about privately testing simple hypotheses: given two distributionsPandQ, and a privacy levelε, how many i.i.d. samples are needed to distinguishPfromQsubject toε-differential privacy, and what sort of tests have optimal sample complexity? Specifically, we characterize this sample complexity up to constant factors in terms of the structure ofPandQand the privacy levelε, and show that this sample complexity is achieved by a certain randomized and clamped variant of the log-likelihood ratio test. Our result is an analogue of the classical Neyman-Pearson lemma in the setting of private hypothesis testing. We also give an application of our result to the private change-point detection. Our characterization applies more generally to hypothesis tests satisfying essentially any notion of algorithmic stability, which is known to imply strong generalization bounds in adaptive data analysis, and thus our results have applications even when privacy is not a primary concern.",611

Springer, Cham","We consider the problem of designing scalable, robust protocols for computing statistics about sensitive data. Specifically, we look at how best to design differentially private protocols in a distributed setting, where each user holds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered two models: the ""central"" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear, which allows greater accuracy; and the ""local"" model, in which users individually randomize their data, and need not trust the server, but accuracy is limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central model without a trusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which limits scalability.In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for distributed differentially private algorithms, which lies between the local and central models. This simple-to-implement model, a special case of the ESA framework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an anonymous channel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum queries, we show that this model provides the power of the central model while avoiding the need to trust a central server and the complexity of cryptographic secure function evaluation. More generally, we give evidence that the power of the shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local models: for a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a widely studied selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity than do central-model protocols.",612

Variants of this task arise naturally in fundamental problems like feature selection and hypothesis testing, and also as subroutines for many sophisticated differentially private algorithms.The standard approaches to these tasks---repeated use of the exponential mechanism or the sparse vector technique---approximately solve this problem given a dataset ofn=O(k−−√logd)samples. We provide a tight lower bound for some very simple variants of the private selection problem. Our lower bound shows that a sample of sizen=Ω(k−−√logd)is required even to achieve a very minimal accuracy guarantee.Our results are based on an extension of the fingerprinting method to sparse selection problems.

A statistical query asks for the expectation of a predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical query is accurate if it is ""close"" to the correct expectation over the distribution. This question was recently studied by Dwork et al., who showed how to answerΩ~(n2)queries efficiently, and also by Hardt and Ullman, who showed that answeringO~(n3)queries is hard. We close the gap between the two bounds and show that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient algorithm that, givennsamples from an unknown distribution, can give valid answers toO(n2)adaptively chosen statistical queries. An implication of our results is that computationally efficient algorithms for answering arbitrary, adaptively chosen statistical queries may as well be differentially private.We obtain our results using a new connection between the problem of answering adaptively chosen statistical queries and a combinatorial object called an interactive fingerprinting code. In order to optimize our hardness result, we give a new Fourier-analytic approach to analyzing fingerprinting codes that is simpler, more flexible, and yields better parameters than previous constructions.",616

DOI: 10.1145/3548606.3560594","This paper proposes using a logic programming language to disentangle X.509 certificate validation policy from mechanism. Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies.

Online services covered by the CCPA are required to provide a hyperlink on their homepage with the text “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” (DNSMPI). The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, a date that was chosen to give data collectors time to study the new law and bring themselves into compliance. In this study, we begin the process of investigating whether websites are complying with the CCPA by focusing on DNSMPI links. Using longitudinal data crawled from the top 1M websites in the Tranco ranking, we examine which websites are including DNSMPI links, whether the websites without DNSMPI links are out of compliance with the law, whether websites are using geofences to dynamically hide DNSMPI links from nonCalifornians, how DNSMPI adoption has changed over time, and how websites are choosing to present DNSMPI links (e.g., in terms of font size, color, and placement). We argue that the answers to these questions are critical for spurring enforcement actions under the law, and helping to shape future privacy laws and regulations, e.g., rule making that will soon commence around the successor to the CCPA, known as the CPRA.",631

We perform manual tests, identify dark patterns in each service, and examine how they persist or differ by modality. Our findings show that while services can employ some dark patterns equally across modalities, many dark patterns vary between platforms, and that these differences saddle people with inconsistent experiences of autonomy, privacy, and control. We conclude by discussing broader implications for policymakers and practitioners, and provide suggestions for furthering dark patterns research.",632

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Misinformation has recently become a well-documented matter of public concern. Existing studies on this topic have hitherto adopted a coarse concept of misinformation, which incorporates a broad spectrum of story types ranging from political conspiracies to misinterpreted pranks. This paper aims to structurize these misinformation stories by leveraging fact-check articles. Our intuition is that key phrases in a fact-check article that identify the misinformation type(s) (e.g., doctored images, urban legends) also act as rationales that determine the verdict of the fact-check (e.g., false). We experiment on rationalized models with domain knowledge as weak supervision to extract these phrases as rationales, and then cluster semantically similar rationales to summarize prevalent misinformation types. Using archived fact-checks from Snopes.com, we identify ten types of misinformation stories. We discuss how these types have evolved over the last ten years and compare their prevalence between the 2016/2020 US presidential elections and the H1N1/COVID-19 pandemics.",635

These consequences are framed under the public's susceptibility to such misinformation — a narrative that needs further investigation and quantification. To this end, our paper proposes an observational approach to model and measure expressed (dis)beliefs in (mis)information by leveraging social media comments as a proxy. We collect a sample of tweets in response to (mis)information and annotate them with (dis)belief labels, explore the dataset using lexicon-based methods, and finally build classifiers based on the state-of-the-art neural transfer-learning models (BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa). Under a domain-specific thresholding strategy for unbiasedness, the best-performing classifier archives macro-F 1 scores around 0.86 for disbelief and 0.80 for belief. Applying the classifier, we conduct a large-scale measurement study and show that, for true/mixed/false claims on social media, 12%/14%/15% of comments express disbelief and 26%/21%/20% of comments express belief. In addition, our results suggest an extremely slight time effect of falsehood awareness, a positive effect of fact-checks to false claims, and differences in (dis)belief across social media platforms.",636

However, programmatic advertising has also given rise to a novel form of ad fraud known as domain spoofing, in which attackers sell counterfeit impressions that claim to be from high-value publishers. To mitigate domain spoofing, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab introduced the ads.txt standard in May 2017 to help ad buyers verify authorized digital ad sellers, as well as to promote overall transparency in programmatic advertising. In this work, we present a 15-month longitudinal, observational study of the ads.txt standard. We do this to understand (1) if it is helping ad buyers to combat domain spoofing and (2) whether the transparency offered by the standard can provide useful data to researchers and privacy advocates. With respect to halting domain spoofing, we observe that over 60% of Alexa Top-100K publishers that run RTB ads have adopted ads.txt, and that ad exchanges and advertisers appear to be honoring the standard. With respect to transparency, the widespread adoption of ads.txt allows us to explicitly identify over 1,000 domains belonging to ad exchanges, without having to rely on crowdsourcing or heuristic methods. However, we also find that ads.txt is still a long way from reaching its full potential. Many publishers have yet to adopt the standard, and we observe major ad exchanges purchasing unauthorized impressions that violate the standard. This opens the door to domain spoofing attacks. Further, ads.txt data often include errors that must be cleaned and mitigated before the data is practically useful.",637

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size.",640

However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs. We implemented this approach in NNSmith which has found 72 new bugs for TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch to date.

SHERLOC: Secure and Holistic Control-Flow Violation Detection on Embedded Systems CCS, 1332-1346. https://doi.org/10.1145/3576915.3623077","Microcontroller-based embedded systems are often programmed in low-level languages and are vulnerable to control-flow hijacking attacks. One approach to prevent such attacks is to enforce control-flow integrity (CFI), but inlined CFI enforcement can pose challenges in embedded systems. For example, it increases binary size and changes memory layout. Trace-based control-flow violation detection (CFVD) offers an alternative that doesn't require instrumentation of the protected software or changes to its memory layout. However, existing CFVD methods used in desktop systems require kernel modifications to store and analyze the trace, which limits their use to monitoring unprivileged applications. But, embedded systems are interrupt-driven, with the majority of processing taking place in the privileged mode. Therefore, it is critical to provide a holistic and system-oriented CFVD solution that can monitor control-flow transfers both within and among privileged and unprivileged components. In this paper, we present SHERLOC, a Secure and Holistic Control-Flow Violation Detection mechanism designed for microcontroller-based embedded systems. SHERLOC ensures security by configuring the hardware tracing unit, storing trace records, and executing the violation detection algorithm in a trusted execution environment, which prevents privileged programs from bypassing monitoring or tampering with the trace. We address the challenges of achieving holistic and system-oriented CFVD by formalizing the problem and monitoring forward and backward edges of unprivileged and privileged programs, as well as control-flow transfers among unprivileged and privileged components. Specifically, SHERLOC overcomes the challenges of identifying legitimate asynchronous interrupts and context switches at run-time by using an interrupt- and scheduling-aware violation detection algorithm. Our evaluations on the ARMv8-M architecture demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SHERLOC.",654

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political.",661

Those are commonly referred to as low-resource domains, which comprise long-tail entities, due to the scarcity of available data. To address this, data augmentation techniques are increasingly being employed to generate additional training instances from the original dataset. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of two prominent text augmentation techniques, Mention Replacement and Contextual Word Replacement, on two widely-used NER models, Bi-LSTM+CRF and BERT. We conduct experiments on four datasets from low-resource domains, and we explore the impact of various combinations of training subset sizes and number of augmented examples. We not only confirm that data augmentation is particularly beneficial for smaller datasets, but we also demonstrate that there is no universally optimal number of augmented examples, i.e., NER practitioners must experiment with different quantities in order to fine-tune their projects.",664

In this context, we introduce an action abstraction scheme which we call asymmetric action abstraction. Asymmetric abstractions allow search algorithms to “pay more attention” to some aspects of the game by unevenly dividing the algorithm’s search effort amongst different aspects of the game. We also introduce four algorithms that search in asymmetrically abstracted game trees to evaluate the effectiveness of our abstraction schemes.

Our solution consists of linear programs that solve the problems exactly and can be implemented using MILP solvers.

Specifically, we embark on the challenge of identifying the tractable answer orderings that allow for ranked direct access with such complexity guarantees. We begin with lexicographic orderings and give a decidable characterization (under conventional complexity assumptions) of the class of tractable lexicographic orderings for every CQ without self-joins. We then continue to the more general orderings by the sum of attribute weights and show for it that ranked direct access is tractable only in trivial cases. Hence, to better understand the computational challenge at hand, we consider the more modest task of providing access to only a single answer (i.e., finding the answer at a given position) - a task that we refer to as the selection problem. We indeed achieve a quasilinear-time algorithm for a subset of the class of full CQs without self-joins, by adopting a solution of Frederickson and Johnson to the classic problem of selection over sorted matrices.

To this end, we extend classic algorithms that find the k -shortest paths in a weighted graph. For full conjunctive queries, including cyclic ones, our approach is optimal in terms of the time to return the top result and the delay between results. These optimality properties are derived for the widely used notion of data complexity, which treats query size as a constant. By performing a careful cost analysis, we are able to uncover a previously unknown tradeoff between two incomparable enumeration approaches: one has lower complexity when the number of returned results is small, the other when the number is very large. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the superiority of our techniques over batch algorithms, which produce the full result and then sort it. Our technique is not only faster for returning the first few results, but on some inputs beats the batch algorithm even when all results are produced.",675

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size.",676

Bugs in these compilers can result in models whose semantics differ from the original ones, producing incorrect results that corrupt the correctness of downstream applications. However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs.

To tame these undefined behaviors, we introduce a framework ouroboros, which builds verified NNs that follow user-defined specifications. These specifications comprise input and output constraints which characterize the behaviors of a NN.

Abstract We present an adaptation of RNN sequence models to the problem of multi-label classification for text, where the target is a set of labels, not a sequence. Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task.",689

We find that convention dominates over innovation, as over 96% of the recorded trials focus on previously tested drug targets, and the tested drugs target only 12% of the human interactome. If current patterns persist, it would take 170 years to target all druggable proteins. We uncover two network-based fundamental mechanisms that currently limit target discovery: preferential attachment, leading to the repeated exploration of previously targeted proteins; and local network effects, limiting exploration to proteins interacting with highly explored proteins. We build on these insights to develop a quantitative network-based model of drug discovery. We demonstrate that the model is able to accurately recreate the exploration patterns observed in clinical trials. Most importantly, we show that a network-based search strategy can widen the scope of drug discovery by guiding exploration to novel proteins that are part of under explored regions in the human interactome.",708

We first unveil the mechanisms responsible for this shortcoming, demonstrating how models rely on shortcuts that leverage the topology of the protein-ligand bipartite network, rather than learning the node features. Then, we introduce AI-Bind, a pipeline that combines network-based sampling strategies with unsupervised pre-training, allowing us to limit the annotation imbalance and improve binding predictions for novel proteins and ligands. We illustrate the value of AI-Bind by predicting drugs and natural compounds with binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and the associated human proteins. We also validate these predictions via docking simulations and comparison with recent experimental evidence, and step up the process of interpreting machine learning prediction of protein-ligand binding by identifying potential active binding sites on the amino acid sequence.

We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions. We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules. Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. Our investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width and deeper GCNs are more capable of learning higher order graph moments.

The assembly of active molecules might have promoted the formation of large pre-biotic polymers that could be the precursors of the informational polymers we observe nowadays. Numerical simulations clearly show that self-propulsion considerably speeds up the assembly of polymers, somewhat in agreement with previous related studies. We conclude by discussing the differences between self-Assembly and self-Organization and discuss the role of self-propelled particles in the development of the self-organized system.

We show how a model that borrows some of these ideas can be used to study polymer formation from a collection of self-propelled monomers. We will not attempt to provide a theoretical description of the active self-assembly process presented here. Instead, we will present only numerical results obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. The motivation for studying the channel system is based on the hypothesis that the formation of organic macro-molecules relevant to the origin of life may have occurred in micro-channels formed either in meteorites [ 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ] or in confined micro-spaces of marine vent chimneys in which molecules are driven by thermal gradients. The results show that the external input of energy, via self-propulsion or other sources (such as ATP), can considerably enhance the assembly of structures. Propulsion considerably improves theassembly of molecules as compared to spontaneous self-assembly. At high temperatures, mostly monomers and dimers coexist, whereas longer polymer appear in negligible amounts. At low temperatures, the average polymer length does not reach a maximum at any value of the self-propulsion force. This is due to the aggregation of molecules and polymers next to the repulsive channel walls, which decreases the rate at which the chains grow. In the high-temperature regime, the system reaches a stationary state within the simulation time. In every case reported in Figure 4 , it can be seen that increasing 𝐹 sp F sp increases the growth rate of the polymer chains. The tail of the distribution reveals that much longer polymers are created. The narrower the channel, the less self- Propulsion force is needed to create long polymers. This effect clearly becomes stronger for narrow channels. The aggregation and jammingof active particles next to the confining Walls has been observed in both numerical simulations and experiments. Self-propulsion could have been an important mechanism for the formation of pre-biotic structures or the synthesis of nanometric structures. The model we have introduced takes into account the full geometry of the molecules by discretizing them into subunits. All authors have read and agree to the published version of the manuscript.

Customary diagnostics for these models are limited because they involve difficult‐to‐interpret residuals and often focus on the fit of one category versus the rest. Our residuals account for associations between categories by using the squared Mahalanobis distances of the observed log‐odds relative to their fitted sampling distributions. Aside from sampling variation, these residuals are exactly normal when the data come from the fitted model. This motivates our use of the residuals to detect model misspecification and overdispersion, in addition to an overall goodness‐of‐fit Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

However, processing and analyzing data in real time is computationally intensive, and limited resources, such as computational power, sensor capabilities, and budget, may constrain the extent to which a system can be monitored comprehensively. To address this, this article develops a particle-based approach that dynamically selects a subset of sensors that provides the highest information about the state of the system in real time. The proposed approach first predicts the amount of uncertainty in the estimation of the state of the system given noisy measurements from different subsets of available sensors. Then, it selects the sensors that reduce this uncertainty the most, enhancing the precision and efficiency of the monitoring process. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated via two coupled multidisciplinary systems in the numerical experiments.",721

These subsystems, referred to as disciplines, contain many types of uncertainty and in many cases are feedback-coupled with each other. In designing these complex systems, one needs to assess the stationary behavior of these systems for the sake of stability and reliability. This requires the system level uncertainty analysis of the multidisciplinary systems, which is often computationally intractable. To overcome this issue, techniques have been developed for capturing the stationary behavior of the coupled multidisciplinary systems through available data of individual disciplines. The accuracy and convergence of the existing techniques depend on a large amount of data from all disciplines, which are not available in many practical problems. Toward this, we have developed an adaptive methodology that adds the minimum possible number of samples from individual disciplines to achieve an accurate and reliable uncertainty propagation in coupled multidisciplinary systems. The proposed method models each discipline function via Gaussian process (GP) regression to derive a closed-form policy. This policy sequentially selects a new sample point that results in the highest uncertainty reduction over the distribution of the coupling design variables. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in the uncertainty analysis of an aerostructural system and a coupled numerical example.",726

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques, also known as particle methods, are a well-known class of parameter estimation methods for this general class of state-space models. Existing SMC-based techniques rely on excessive sampling of the parameter space, which makes their computation intractable for large systems or tall data sets. Bayesian optimization techniques have been used for fast inference in state-space models with intractable likelihoods. These techniques aim to find the maximum of the likelihood function by sequential sampling of the parameter space through a single SMC approximator. Various SMC approximators with different fidelities and computational costs are often available for sample-based likelihood approximation. In this paper, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization algorithm for the inference of general nonlinear state-space models (MFBO-SSM), which enables simultaneous sequential selection of parameters and approximators. The accuracy and speed of the algorithm are demonstrated by numerical experiments using synthetic gene expression data from a gene regulatory network model and real data from the VIX stock price index.",729

Most of the existing adaptive controllers for MDPs with unknown dynamics are based on the reinforcement learning framework and rely on large data sets acquired by sustained direct interaction with the system or via a simulator. This is not feasible in many applications, due to ethical, economic, and physical constraints. The proposed framework addresses the data poverty issue by decomposing the problem into an offline planning stage that does not rely on sustained direct interaction with the system or simulator and an online execution stage. In the offline process, parallel Gaussian process temporal difference (GPTD) learning techniques are employed for near-optimal Bayesian approximation of the expected discounted reward over a sample drawn from the prior distribution of unknown parameters. In the online stage, the action with the maximum expected return with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameters is selected. This is achieved by an approximation of the posterior distribution using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, followed by constructing multiple Gaussian processes over the parameter space for efficient prediction of the means of the expected return at the MCMC sample. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a simple dynamical system model with continuous state and action spaces, as well as a more complex model for a metastatic melanoma gene regulatory network observed through noisy synthetic gene expression data.",732

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present our HABERTOR model for detecting hatespeech in large scale user-generated content. Inspired by the recent success of the BERT model, we propose several modifications to BERT to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification task. HABERTOR inherits BERT’s architecture, but is different in four aspects: (i) it generates its own vocabularies and is pre-trained from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech dataset; (ii) it consists of Quaternion-based factorized components, resulting in a much smaller number of parameters, faster training and inferencing, as well as less memory usage; (iii) it uses our proposed multi-source ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input sources, to further enhance its effectiveness; and (iv) it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed fine-grained and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its robustness. Through experiments on the large-scale real-world hatespeech dataset with 1.4M annotated comments, we show that HABERTOR works better than 15 state-of-the-art hatespeech detection methods, including fine-tuning Language Models. In particular, comparing with BERT, our HABERTOR is 4 5 times faster in the training/inferencing phase, uses less than 1/3 of the memory, and has better performance, even though we pre-train it by using less than 1% of the number of words. Our generalizability analysis shows that HABERTOR transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to BERT for the hatespeech classification.",735

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract The neural attention mechanism plays an important role in many natural language processing applications. In particular, multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. However, without explicit constraining, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model’s representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective. Based on the recently developed particle-optimization sampling techniques, we propose a non-parametric approach that explicitly improves the repulsiveness in multi-head attention and consequently strengthens model’s expressiveness. Remarkably, our Bayesian interpretation provides theoretical inspirations on the not-well-understood questions: why and how one uses multi-head attention. Extensive experiments on various attention models and applications demonstrate that the proposed repulsive attention can improve the learned feature diversity, leading to more informative representations with consistent performance improvement on multiple tasks.",736

Furthermore, the normalization involves the prediction of both operation types and token labels, enabling TNT to learn from more challenging tasks than the standard task of masked word recovery. As a result, the experiments demonstrate that TNT outperforms strong baselines on the hate speech classification task.

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption.",739

These approaches fail to capture another potential form of misinformation with a much larger audience: factual news from mainstream sources ('real' news) repurposed to promote false or misleading narratives. We operationalize narratives using an existing unsupervised NLP technique and examine the narratives present in misinformation content. We find that certain articles from reliable outlets are shared by a disproportionate number of users who also shared fake news on Twitter. We consider these 'real' news articles to be co-shared with fake news. We show that co-shared articles contain existing misinformation narratives at a significantly higher rate than articles from the same reliable outlets that are not co-shared with fake news. This holds true even when articles are chosen following strict criteria of reliability for the outlets and after accounting for the alternative explanation of partisan curation of articles. For example, we observe that a recent article published by The Washington Post titled ""Vaccinated people now make up a majority of COVID deaths"" was disproportionately shared by Twitter users with a history of sharing anti-vaccine false news reports. Our findings suggest a strategic repurposing of mainstream news by conveyors of misinformation as a way to enhance the reach and persuasiveness of misleading narratives. We also conduct a comprehensive case study to help highlight how such repurposing can happen on Twitter as a consequence of the inclusion of particular narratives in the framing of mainstream news.",740

Engagement Outweighs Exposure to Partisan and Unreliable News within Google Search CoRR, abs/2201.00074. https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00074","If popular online platforms systematically expose their users to partisan and unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues like rising political polarization. This concern is central to the echo chamber and filter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information sources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the URLs seen while using an online platform, and engagement, the URLs selected while on that platform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of obtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their regular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data, or estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their centrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have focused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and engagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. We found that participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent relationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed to on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results they chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall engagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed to on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news sources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall. These results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable news on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by users' own choices.",743

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Stance detection, which aims to determine whether an individual is for or against a target concept, promises to uncover public opinion from large streams of social media data. Yet even human annotation of social media content does not always capture “stance” as measured by public opinion polls. We demonstrate this by directly comparing an individual’s self-reported stance to the stance inferred from their social media data. Leveraging a longitudinal public opinion survey with respondent Twitter handles, we conducted this comparison for 1,129 individuals across four salient targets. We find that recall is high for both “Pro’’ and “Anti’’ stance classifications but precision is variable in a number of cases. We identify three factors leading to the disconnect between text and author stance: temporal inconsistencies, differences in constructs, and measurement errors from both survey respondents and annotators. By presenting a framework for assessing the limitations of stance detection models, this work provides important insight into what stance detection truly measures.",744

To address this, data augmentation techniques are increasingly being employed to generate additional training instances from the original dataset. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of two prominent text augmentation techniques, Mention Replacement and Contextual Word Replacement, on two widely-used NER models, Bi-LSTM+CRF and BERT. We conduct experiments on four datasets from low-resource domains, and we explore the impact of various combinations of training subset sizes and number of augmented examples. We not only confirm that data augmentation is particularly beneficial for smaller datasets, but we also demonstrate that there is no universally optimal number of augmented examples, i.e., NER practitioners must experiment with different quantities in order to fine-tune their projects.",747

We also introduce four algorithms that search in asymmetrically abstracted game trees to evaluate the effectiveness of our abstraction schemes.

An algorithm for decoy-free false discovery rate estimation in XL-MS/MS proteomics Bioinform., 40, i428-i436. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae233","Motivation Cross-linking tandem mass spectrometry (XL-MS/MS) is an established analytical platform used to determine distance constraints between residues within a protein or from physically interacting proteins, thus improving our understanding of protein structure and function. To aid biological discovery with XL-MS/MS, it is essential that pairs of chemically linked peptides be accurately identified, a process that requires: (i) database search, that creates a ranked list of candidate peptide pairs for each experimental spectrum and (ii) false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, that determines the probability of a false match in a group of top-ranked peptide pairs with scores above a given threshold. Currently, the only available FDR estimation mechanism in XL-MS/MS is the target-decoy approach (TDA). However, despite its simplicity, TDA has both theoretical and practical limitations that impact the estimation accuracy and increase run time over potential decoy-free approaches (DFAs). Results We introduce a novel decoy-free framework for FDR estimation in XL-MS/MS. Our approach relies on multi-sample mixtures of skew normal distributions, where the latent components correspond to the scores of correct peptide pairs (both peptides identified correctly), partially incorrect peptide pairs (one peptide identified correctly, the other incorrectly), and incorrect peptide pairs (both peptides identified incorrectly). To learn these components, we exploit the score distributions of first- and second-ranked peptide-spectrum matches for each experimental spectrum and subsequently estimate FDR using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm with constraints. We evaluate the method on ten datasets and provide evidence that the proposed DFA is theoretically sound and a viable alternative to TDA owing to its good performance in terms of accuracy, variance of estimation, and run time.

Well-estimated class priors are key to accurate approximation of posterior distributions and are necessary for the recovery of true classification performance. While significant progress has been made in the past decade, there remains a need for accurate strategies that scale to big data. Motivated by this need, we propose an intuitive and fast nonparametric algorithm to estimate class proportions. Unlike any of the previous methods, our algorithm uses a sampling strategy to repeatedly (1) draw an example from the set of positives, (2) record the minimum distance to any of the unlabeled examples, and (3) remove the nearest unlabeled example. We show that the point of sharp increase in the recorded distances corresponds to the desired proportion of positives in the unlabeled set and train a deep neural network to identify that point. Our distance-based algorithm is evaluated on forty datasets and compared to all currently available methods. We provide evidence that this new approach results in the most accurate performance and can be readily used on large datasets.",754

To further extend our approach to structured objects such as ontologies, we introduce information-theoretic metrics on directed acyclic graphs drawn according to a fixed probability distribution.

Although classification has been extensively studied over the past decades, there remain understudied problems when the training data violate the main statistical assumptions relied upon for accurate learning and model characterization. This particularly holds true in the open world setting where observations of a phenomenon generally guarantee its presence but the absence of such evidence cannot be interpreted as the evidence of its absence. Learning from such data is often referred to as positive-unlabeled learning, a form of semi-supervised learning where all labeled data belong to one (say, positive) class. To improve the best practices in the field, we here study the quality of estimated performance in positive-unlabeled learning in the biomedical domain. We provide evidence that such estimates can be wildly inaccurate, depending on the fraction of positive examples in the unlabeled data and the fraction of negative examples mislabeled as positives in the labeled data. We then present correction methods for four such measures and demonstrate that the knowledge or accurate estimates of class priors in the unlabeled data and noise in the labeled data are sufficient for the recovery of true classification performance.

Enumerating consistent sub-graphs of directed acyclic graphs: an insight into biomedical ontologies. Bioinformatics (2018) 34(13): i313-i322.","Abstract Motivation: Modern problems of concept annotation associate an object of interest (gene, individual, text document) with a set of interrelated textual descriptors (functions, diseases, topics), often organized in concept hierarchies or ontologies. Most ontology can be seen as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts. Given an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent sub-graph; that is, a sub-graph such that if an object is annotated by a particular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that generalize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large space of possible consistent sub-graphs; however, until now we have not been aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a given ontology. Results: We propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent sub-graphs of DAGs. The algorithm recursively partitions the graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We prove the correctness of this algorithm, propose several practical accelerations, evaluate it on random graphs and then apply it to characterize four major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights into the complexity of concept annotation spaces and its potential influence on the predictability of ontological annotation.

The available methods to assess the impact of these variants rely primarily upon evolutionary conservation with little to no consideration of the structural and functional implications for the protein. They further do not provide information to the user regarding specific molecular alterations potentially causative of disease. Results: To address this, we investigate protein features underlying loss-of-function genetic variation and develop a machine learning method, MutPred-LOF, for the discrimination of pathogenic and tolerated variants that can also generate hypotheses on specific molecular events disrupted by the variant. We investigate a large set of human variants derived from the Human Gene Mutation Database, ClinVar and the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Our prediction method shows an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.85 for all loss-of-function variants and 0.75 for proteins in which both pathogenic and neutral variants have been observed. We applied MutPred-LOF to a set of 1142 de novo vari3ants from neurodevelopmental disorders and find enrichment of pathogenic variants in affected individuals. Overall, our results highlight the potential of computational tools to elucidate causal mechanisms underlying loss of protein function in loss-of-function variants.

We extend the results to a noisy setting where some of the examples labeled positive are in fact negative and show that the correction also requires the knowledge of the proportion of noisy examples in the labeled positives.

We prove that these univariate transforms preserve the class prior, enabling estimation in the univariate space and avoiding kernel density estimation for high-dimensional data. The theoretical development and parametric and nonparametric algorithms proposed here constitute an important step towards wide-spread use of robust classification algorithms for positive-unlabeled data.",762

The loss and gain of functional amino acid residues is a common mechanism causing human inherited disease. PLoS Comput. Biol. (2016) 12(8): e1005091.","Abstract Elucidating the precise molecular events altered by disease-causing genetic variants represents a major challenge in translational bioinformatics. To this end, many studies have investigated the structural and functional impact of amino acid substitutions. Most of these studies were however limited in scope to either individual molecular functions or were concerned with functional effects (e.g. deleterious vs. neutral) without specifically considering possible molecular alterations. The recent growth of structural, molecular and genetic data presents an opportunity for more comprehensive studies to consider the structural environment of a residue of interest, to hypothesize specific molecular effects of sequence variants and to statistically associate these effects with genetic disease. In this study, we analyzed data sets of disease-causing and putatively neutral human variants mapped to protein 3D structures as part of a systematic study of the loss and gain of various types of functional attribute potentially underlying pathogenic molecular alterations. We first propose a formal model to assess probabilistically function-impacting variants. We then develop an array of structure-based functional residue predictors, evaluate their performance, and use them to quantify the impact of disease-causing amino acid substitutions on catalytic activity, metal binding, macromolecular binding, ligand binding, allosteric regulation and post-translational modifications. We show that our methodology generates actionable biological hypotheses for up to 41% of disease-causing genetic variants mapped to protein structures suggesting that it can be reliably used to guide experimental validation. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of disease-causing human variants mapping to protein structures are function-altering both in the presence and absence of stability disruption.",763

Our solution consists of linear programs that solve the problems exactly and can be implemented using MILP solvers. These solvers also support additional constraints on the scoring function, allowing the user to explore competing hypotheses through alternative scoring functions. We also discuss techniques for dealing with numerical imprecision and for improving performance and scalability. Experiments demonstrate that RankExplain can solve realistic problems.

Specifically, we embark on the challenge of identifying the tractable answer orderings that allow for ranked direct access with such complexity guarantees. We begin with lexicographic orderings and give a decidable characterization (under conventional complexity assumptions) of the class of tractable lexicographic orderings for every CQ without self-joins. We then continue to the more general orderings by the sum of attribute weights and show for it that ranked direct access is tractable only in trivial cases. Hence, to better understand the computational challenge at hand, we consider the more modest task of providing access to only a single answer (i.e., finding the answer at a given position) - a task that we refer to as the selection problem. We indeed achieve a quasilinear-time algorithm for a subset of the class of full CQs without self-joins, by adopting a solution of Frederickson and Johnson to the classic problem of selection over sorted matrices.

Yet SQL can be hard to read, even for expert users or the original creator of a query. We conjecture that it is possible to capture the logical intent of queries in automatically-generated visual diagrams that can help users understand the meaning of queries faster and more accurately than SQL text alone. We present initial steps in that direction with visual diagrams that are based on the first-order logic foundation of SQL and can capture the meaning of deeply nested queries. Our diagrams build upon a rich history of diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic and were designed using a large body of human-computer interaction best practices: they are minimal in that no visual element is superfluous; they are unambiguous in that no two queries with different semantics map to the same visualization; and they extend previously existing visual representations of relational schemata and conjunctive queries in a natural way. An experimental evaluation involving 42 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that with only a 2--3 minute static tutorial, participants could interpret queries meaningfully faster with our diagrams than when reading SQL alone. Moreover, we have evidence that our visual diagrams result in participants making fewer errors than with SQL. We believe that more regular exposure to diagrammatic representations of SQL can give rise to a pattern-based and thus more intuitive use and re-use of SQL.

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption.",769

CoRR, abs/2404.14141. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14141","Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed problem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities and evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a tension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the contest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The competitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to their self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their peers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless on 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000 individuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative explanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this tension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly competitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest competitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when high-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not directly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level use of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level outcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term participation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to participate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This suggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future participation. These findings have important implications for the literature on crowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing communities.",771

We further explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest -- social (non-profit) or monetary (for-profit) -- moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness. We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives, such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators' preferences (and the ability to satisfy diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives.

We show that the presence of these hybrid groups promotes stable diversity in signaling among other groups in the population.

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1).

But applying NNs in these critical systems is challenging: people have to risk getting unexpected outcomes from NNs because NN behaviors are not well-defined. To tame these undefined behaviors, we introduce a framework ouroboros, which builds verified NNs that follow user-defined specifications. These specifications comprise input and output constraints which characterize the behaviors of a NN. We do a case study on database learned indexes to demonstrate that training verified NN models is possible. Though many challenges remain, ouroboros enables us, for the first time, to apply NNs in critical systems with _confidence_.",785

It is the first system that combines (a) black-box checking, of (b) serializability, while (c) scaling to real-world online transactional processing workloads. The core technical challenge is that the underlying search problem is computationally expensive. COBRA tames that problem by starting with a suitable SMT solver. COBRA then introduces several new techniques, including a new encoding of the validity condition; hardware acceleration to prune inputs to the solver; and a transaction segmentation mechanism that enables scaling and garbage collection. Cobra imposes modest overhead on clients, improves over baselines by 10× in verification cost, and (unlike the baselines) supports continuous verification.

Optimal adjustment sets for causal query estimation in partially observed biomolecular networks Bioinform., 39, 494-503. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad270","Causal query estimation in biomolecular networks commonly selects a ‘valid adjustment set’, i.e. a subset of network variables that eliminates the bias of the estimator. A same query may have multiple valid adjustment sets, each with a different variance. When networks are partially observed, current methods use graph-based criteria to find an adjustment set that minimizes asymptotic variance. Unfortunately, many models that share the same graph topology, and therefore same functional dependencies, may differ in the processes that generate the observational data. In these cases, the topology-based criteria fail to distinguish the variances of the adjustment sets. This deficiency can lead to sub-optimal adjustment sets, and to miss-characterization of the effect of the intervention. We propose an approach for deriving ‘optimal adjustment sets’ that takes into account the nature of the data, bias and finite-sample variance of the estimator, and cost. It empirically learns the data generating processes from historical experimental data, and characterizes the properties of the estimators by simulation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in four biomolecular Case studies with different topologies and different data generation processes.

A noise-robust deep clustering of biomolecular ions improves interpretability of mass spectrometric images Bioinform., 39. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad067","Motivation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) analyzes complex biological samples such as tissues. It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. Results We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

However, the methods used to collect, analyze, and visualize data collected with Likert scales are inconsistent among evaluations in visualization papers. In this paper, we examine the use of Likert scales as a tool for measuring subjective response in a systematic review of 134 visualization evaluations published between 2009 and 2019. We find that papers with both objective and subjective measures do not hold the same reporting and analysis standards for both aspects of their evaluation, producing less rigorous work for the subjective qualities measured by Likert scales. Additionally, we demonstrate that many papers are inconsistent in their interpretations of Likert data as discrete or continuous and may even sacrifice statistical power by applying nonparametric tests unnecessarily. Finally, we identify instances where key details about Likert item construction with the potential to bias participant responses are omitted from evaluation methodology reporting, inhibiting the feasibility and reliability of future replication studies. We summarize recommendations from other fields for best practices with Likert data in visualization evaluations, based on the results of our survey.

INP consists of two components, a spatiotemporal surrogate model built upon Neural Process (NP) family and an acquisition function for active learning. For surrogate modeling, we develop Spatiotemporal Neural Process (STNP) to mimic the simulator dynamics. For active learning, we propose a novel acquisition function, Latent Information Gain (LIG), calculated in the latent space of NP based models. We perform a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LIG reduces sample complexity compared with random sampling in high dimensions. We also conduct empirical studies on three complex spatiotemporal simulators for reaction diffusion, heat flow, and infectious disease. The results demonstrate that STNP outperforms the baselines in the offline learning setting and LIG achieves the state-of-the-art for Bayesian active learning.",796

SliceLens uses the metrics to guide the user towards combinations of features that create potentially interesting subsets in two ways. First, SliceLens assigns a rating to each feature based on the subsets that would be created by selecting that feature.

We find that many features of the data or visual style can lead to ""octopus-like"" thinking in visualizations, even without the use of an explicit octopus motif.

These errors can be caught by critical readings of visualizations, but readers must have a high level of data and design literacy and must be paying close attention. To address this issue, we introduce VisuaLint: a technique for surfacing chart construction errors in situ. Inspired by the ubiquitous red wavy underline that indicates spelling mistakes, visualization elements that contain errors (e.g., axes and legends) are sketchily rendered and accompanied by a concise annotation. VisuaLint is unobtrusive — it does not interfere with reading a visualization — and its direct display establishes a close mapping between erroneous elements and the expression of error. We demonstrate five examples of VisualLint and present the results of a crowdsourced evaluation (N = 62) of its efficacy. These results contribute an empirical baseline proficiency for recognizing chart construction errors, and indicate near-universal difficulty in error identification. We find that people more reliably identify chart construction errors after being shown examples of VisuaLint, and prefer more verbose explanations for unfamiliar or less obvious flaws.",814

Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real-life use cases.

Yet SQL can be hard to read, even for expert users or the original creator of a query. We conjecture that it is possible to capture the logical intent of queries in automatically-generated visual diagrams that can help users understand the meaning of queries faster and more accurately than SQL text alone. We present initial steps in that direction with visual diagrams that are based on the first-order logic foundation of SQL and can capture the meaning of deeply nested queries. Our diagrams build upon a rich history of diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic and were designed using a large body of human-computer interaction best practices: they are minimal in that no visual element is superfluous; they are unambiguous in that no two queries with different semantics map to the same visualization; and they extend previously existing visual representations of relational schemata and conjunctive queries in a natural way. An experimental evaluation involving 42 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that with only a 2--3 minute static tutorial, participants could interpret queries meaningfully faster with our diagrams than when reading SQL alone. Moreover, we have evidence that our visual diagrams result in participants making fewer errors than with SQL. We believe that more regular exposure to diagrammatic representations of SQL can give rise to a pattern-based and thus more intuitive use and re-use of SQL.

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries.

In this article, we first showcase a user study on how anchoring bias can potentially affect mental model formations when users initially interact with an intelligent system and the role of explanations in addressing this bias. Using a video activity recognition tool in cooking domain, we asked participants to verify whether a set of kitchen policies are being followed, with each policy focusing on a weakness or a strength. We controlled the order of the policies and the presence of explanations to test our hypotheses. Our main finding shows that those who observed system strengths early on were more prone to automation bias and made significantly more errors due to positive first impressions of the system, while they built a more accurate mental model of the system competencies.

IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, (2021).","Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and ""get their hands on"" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.",842

Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians.

This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables.

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time.

Poke Typing: Effects of Hand-Tracking Input and Key Representation on Mid-Air Text Entry Performance in Virtual Reality ICMI, 293-301. https://doi.org/10.1145/3678957.3685734","In this paper, we investigated the effects of hand-tracking input on mid-air text entry performance in virtual reality as a function of the key representations used in the virtual keyboard, i.e., flat 2D keys vs. protruded 3D keys. This led to a comparison among four conditions: controller input using 2D keys, controller input using 3D keys, hand-tracking input using 2D keys, hand-tracking input using 3D keys. Results from our user study (n = 28) revealed that controller input (15.3 WPM) outperformed hand-tracking input (13.8 WPM) in terms of text entry rates and that protruded 3D keys (15.6 WPM) led to faster text entry performance than did flat 2D keys (13.4 WPM). While the four conditions did not differ in error rates, flat 2D keys led to a greater number of character corrections. In addition, results showed that compared to flat 2D keys, protruded 3D keys lowered the perceived mental workload of the text entry task. These results indicate that despite the technological advances in hand-tracking technology, controller input is still more performant than hand-tracking input for VR text entry tasks and that protruded 3D keys afford faster text entry and better user experience than do flat 2D keys. That said, hand-tracking input can still be used for mid-air text entry without extreme performance losses.",852

However, little is known about how these warnings should be structured to maximize effectiveness in helping with people PSE navigate visual media safely. The design space for photosensitivity warnings is vast and includes questions such as what details to include about strobing light sequences or the content itself, where to place warnings within an interface, and what methods to use to extract information about the strobing light sequences (e.g., crowdsourced or automated methods). In this work, we contribute a thematic analysis of crowdsourced warnings drawn from the DoesTheDogDie online forum and an interview study with five people who have been diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy about design considerations for photosensitivity warnings on digital platforms. To guide our interviews, we assembled examples of both crowdsourced and automated warnings about seizure-inducing content in films. Automated warnings were presented in the form of a high fidelity sketch demonstrating what an automated system for photosensitivity warnings might look like when deployed by a film streaming platform.

Checkpointing is an important component in any strategy for software resilience and for long-running jobs that must be executed by chaining together time-bounded resource allocations. This work solves an old problem: a practical and general algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI that is both efficient and compatible with most of the latest network software. Transparent checkpointing is attractive due to its generality and ease of use for most MPI application developers. Earlier efforts at transparent checkpointing for MPI, one decade ago, had two difficult problems: (i) by relying on a specific MPI implementation tied to a specific network technology; and (ii) by failing to demonstrate sufficiently low runtime overhead.Problem (i) (network dependence) was already solved in 2019 by MANA's introduction of split processes. Problem (ii) (efficient runtime overhead) is solved in this work. This paper introduces an approach that avoids these limitations, employing a novel topological sort to algorithmically determine a safe future synchronization point. The algorithm is valid for both blocking and non-blocking collective communication in MPI. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach through both micro-benchmarks and a set of five real-world MPI applications, notably including the widely used VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package), which is responsible for 11% of the workload on the Perlmutter supercomputer at Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory.

The problem is made more difficult when supporting collective operations across processes, such as barrier, reduce operations, scatter and gather, etc. Some processes may have reached the barrier or other collective operation, while other processes wait a long time to reach that same barrier or collective operation. At least two solutions are well-known in the literature: (I) draining in-flight network messages and then freezing the network at checkpoint time; and (ii) adding a barrier prior to the collective operation, and either completing the operation or aborting the barrier if not all processes are present. Both solutions suffer important drawbacks. The code in the first solution must be updated whenever one ports to a newer network. The second solution implies additional barrier-related network traffic prior to each collective operation. This work presents a third solution that avoids both drawbacks. There is no additional barrier-related traffic, and the solution is implemented entirely above the network layer. The work is demonstrated in the context of transparent checkpointing of MPI libraries for parallel computation, where each of the first two solutions have already been used in prior systems, and then abandoned due to the aforementioned drawbacks.

While the totality of SG data represents a tremendous contribution to genomics and structural biology, reliable functional information for these proteins is generally lacking. Better functional predictions for SG proteins will add substantial value to the structural information already obtained. Our method described herein, Graph Representation of Active Sites for Prediction of Function (GRASP-Func), predicts quickly and accurately the biochemical function of proteins by representing residues at the predicted local active site as graphs rather than in Cartesian coordinates. We compare the GRASP-Func method to our previously reported method, Structurally Aligned Local Sites of Activity (SALSA), using the Ribulose Phosphate Binding Barrel (RPBB), 6-Hairpin Glycosidase (6-HG), and Concanavalin A-like Lectins/Glucanase (CAL/G) superfamilies as test cases. In each of the superfamilies, SALSA and the much faster method GRASP-Func yield similar correct classification of previously characterized proteins, providing a validated benchmark for the new method. In addition, we analyzed SG proteins using our SALSA and GRASP-Func methods to predict function. Forty-one SG proteins in the RPBB superfamily, nine SG proteins in the 6-HG superfamily, and one SG protein in the CAL/G superfamily were successfully classified into one of the functional families in their respective superfamily by both methods. This improved, faster, validated computational method can yield more reliable predictions of function that can be used for a wide variety of applications by the community.

To program these architectures using ordinary languages such as C, a dataflow compiler must transform the original sequential, imperative program into an equivalent dataflow graph, composed of dataflow operators running in parallel. This transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in the original imperative programs. We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture. Our tool uncovers 8 compiler bugs where the compiler outputs incorrect dataflow graphs, including a data race that is otherwise hard to discover via testing. After repairing these bugs, our tool verifies the correct compilation of all programs in the RipTide benchmark suite.",871

On the one hand, a probability theorist decomposes probabilistic state along the simple and natural product of probability spaces. On the other hand, recently developed probabilistic separation logics decompose state via relatively unfamiliar measure-theoretic constructions for computing unions of sigma-algebras and probability measures. We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-setlike models of probability.",875

Constraint-based generators ensure that certain properties hold in each design they output. However, when deployed a general-purpose solver is often required, thus guarantees come with unpredictable search times and little control over sequentially-generated outputs. In this paper, we outline how we can encode design constraints into a compact circuit representation that affords generation without search. These generators yield samples that are distributed uniformly over the space of valid designs. We illustrate our approach with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) in comparison to the traditional approach with answer-set programming (ASP) in two scenarios: a grid-based tile placement scenario inspired by WaveFunctionCollapse, and a playable platformer level design scenario. These compiled design-space models make constraint-based methods easier to deploy by improving on both the running time and diversity of previous constraint-based methods.",876

Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these approaches are not using.

This combining operation forms the basis for our model of separation, and produces a logic with many pleasant properties. In particular, Lilac has a frame rule identical to the ordinary one, and naturally accommodates advanced features like continuous random variables and reasoning about quantitative properties of programs.

Existing quantum circuit simulators do not address the common traits of variational algorithms, namely: 1) their ability to work with noisy qubits and operations, 2) their repeated execution of the same circuits but with different parameters, and 3) the fact that they sample from circuit final wavefunctions to drive a classical optimization routine. We present a quantum circuit simulation toolchain based on logical abstractions targeted for simulating variational algorithms. Our proposed toolchain encodes quantum amplitudes and noise probabilities in a probabilistic graphical model, and it compiles the circuits to logical formulas that support efficient repeated simulation of and sampling from quantum circuits for different parameters.

The computational challenge of probabilistic inference remains the primary roadblock for applying PPLs in practice. Inference is fundamentally hard, so there is no one-size-fits all solution. In this work, we target scalable inference for an important class of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete . Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis, network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis, but they prove to be challenging for existing PPLs. We develop a domain-specific probabilistic programming language called Dice that features a new approach to exact discrete probabilistic program inference. Dice exploits program structure in order to factorize inference, enabling us to perform exact inference on probabilistic programs with hundreds of thousands of random variables. Our key technical contribution is a new reduction from discrete probabilistic programs to weighted model counting (WMC). This reduction separates the structure of the distribution from its parameters, enabling logical reasoning tools to exploit that structure for probabilistic inference. We (1) show how to compositionally reduce Dice inference to WMC, (2) prove this compilation correct with respect to a denotational semantics, (3) empirically demonstrate the performance benefits over prior approaches, and (4) analyze the types of structure that allow Dice to scale to large probabilistic programs.",882

The score function depends on several parameters (weights, caps, thresholds) that can be configured by applications using GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is written in English and its resilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is supported empirically by emulation testing using an implementation in Golang.In this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience of GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model of GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed by the GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary size and topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove and disprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security properties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior, and rewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can be configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad behavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations for two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains. We show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0 network (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving peers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously misbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores so that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub.",888

Many formal frameworks have been developed to verify the safety of SMR implementations, but there is still a gap in the verification of their liveness. Existing liveness proofs are either limited to the network level or do not cover popular partially synchronous protocols. We introduce LiDO, a consensus model that enables the verification of both safety and liveness of implementations through refinement. We observe that current consensus models cannot handle liveness because they do not include a pacemaker state. We show that by adding a pacemaker state to the LiDO model, we can express the liveness properties of SMR protocols as a few safety properties that can be easily verified by refinement proofs.

As evidence we observe that nearly all of them avoid the complex, but important issue of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration's primary challenge lies in how it interacts with a protocol's core safety invariants. To handle this increased complexity, we introduce the Adore model, whose novel abstract state hides network-level communications while capturing dependencies between committed and uncommitted states, as well as metadata like election quorums. It includes first-class support for a generic reconfiguration command that can be instantiated with a variety of implementations.

We propose a novel, compositional, atomic distributed object (ADO) model for strongly consistent distributed systems that combines the best of both options. The object-oriented API abstracts over protocol-specific details and decouples high-level correctness reasoning from implementation choices. At the same time, it intentionally exposes an abstract view of certain key distributed failure cases, thus allowing for more fine-grained control over them than SMR-like models. We demonstrate that proving properties even of composite distributed systems can be straightforward with our Coq verification framework, Advert, thanks to the ADO model.

We present the design, implementation, and verification of a system called WormSpace that provides developers with an address space of WORs, implementing each WOR via a Paxos instance. We describe three applications built over WormSpace: a flexible, efficient Multi-Paxos implementation; a shared log implementation with lower append latency than the state-of-the-art; and a fault-tolerant transaction coordinator that uses an optimal number of round-trips. We show that these applications are simple, easy to verify, and match the performance of unverified monolithic implementations. We use a modular layered verification approach to link the proofs for WormSpace, its applications, and a verified operating system to produce the first verified distributed system stack from the application to the operating system.",899

For example, a server may spread terabytes of data across many different storage media, ranging from magnetic disks, DRAM, NAND-based solid state drives (SSDs), as well as hybrid drives that package various combinations of these technologies. It follows that access latencies to data can vary hugely depending on which media the data resides on. At the same time, modern storage systems naturally retain older versions of data due to the prevalence of log-structured designs and caches in software and hardware layers. In a sense, a contemporary storage system is very similar to a small-scale distributed system, opening the door to consistency/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose a class of local storage systems called StaleStores that support relaxed consistency, returning stale data for better performance. We describe several examples of StaleStores, and show via emulations that serving stale data can improve access latency by between 35% and 20X. We describe a particular StaleStore called Yogurt, a weakly consistent local block storage system. Depending on the application's consistency requirements (e.g. bounded staleness, mono-tonic reads, read-my-writes, etc.), Yogurt queries the access costs for different versions of data within tolerable staleness bounds and returns the fastest version. We show that a distributed key-value store running on top of Yogurt obtains a 6X speed-up for access latency by trading off consistency and performance within individual storage servers.",900

As a result, new high-level storage abstractions—and new designs for existing abstractions—are difficult to realize, requiring developers to implement from scratch complex functionality such as failure atomicity and fine-grained concurrency control. In this paper, we argue that pushing transactional isolation into the block store (in addition to atomicity and durability) is both viable and broadly useful, resulting in simpler high-level storage systems that provide strong semantics without sacrificing performance. We present Isotope, a new block store that supports ACID transactions over block reads and writes. Internally, Isotope uses a new multi-version concurrency control protocol that exploits fine-grained, sub-block parallelism in workloads and offers both strict serializability and snapshot isolation guarantees. We implemented several high-level storage systems over Isotope, including two key-value stores that implement the LevelDB API over a hashtable and B-tree, respectively, and a POSIX filesystem. We show that Isotope’s block-level transactions enable systems that are simple (100s of lines of code), robust (i.e., providing ACID guarantees), and fast (e.g., 415 MB/s for random file writes). We also show that these systems can be composed using Isotope, providing applications with transactions across different high-level constructs such as files, directories and key-value pairs.

However, these environmental assumptions may occasionally be violated due to modeling errors or faults. Ideally, the system guarantees its critical properties even under some of these violations, i.e., the system is \emph{robust} against environmental deviations. This paper proposes a notion of \emph{robustness} as an explicit, first-class property of a transition system that captures how robust it is against possible \emph{deviations} in the environment. We modeled deviations as a set of \emph{transitions} that may be added to the original environment. Our robustness notion then describes the safety envelope of this system, i.e., it captures all sets of extra environment transitions for which the system still guarantees a desired property. We show that being able to explicitly reason about robustness enables new types of system analysis and design tasks beyond the common verification problem stated above.

Toward Space-Time WaveFunctionCollapse for Level and Solution Generation AIIDE, 25-34. https://doi.org/10.1609/aiide.v20i1.31863","Abstract WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) is a constraint-satisfaction-based approach to procedural content generation via machine learning (PCGML). It is relatively easy to implement and requires very little training data, making it a popular approach. Generated game levels are guaranteed to look locally similar totheir example tilemaps; however, local adjacency rules often fail to capture global solvability rules, potentially making many such levels unplayable. Existing approaches to improving the solvability of WFC-generated levels typically require adding additional game-specific information in the form of global constraints, substantially increasing the complexity and time required for setup. The purpose of this work is to explore whether using level solutions as training data can allow WFC to learn solvability constraints and game mechanics. We have implemented a novel space-time approach that uses three-dimensional space-time blocks representing solutions to 2D levels as both input and output. Experiments using this method show that space-time WFC is capable of demonstrating localized game mechanics and creating small playable levels with given solutions. However, levels are slow to generate, and some high-level constraints are still not captured.",914

We used an algorithmic solver to estimate the difficulty of the puzzles by capturing the number of ``solver loops'' through the algorithm. This characteristic was used to generate and evaluate a set of puzzles of varying algorithmic difficulty using constrained MAP-Elites. Then, we ran a user study to gather information on the player experience of these puzzles. We tested the relationship between solver loops and player experience on generated puzzles and found that the number of solver loops is statistically significantly correlated with subjective perception of difficulty and borderline statistically significantly correlated with puzzle correctness.",915

Thus, we investigate if quality-diversity approaches can similarly improve solution variety while also benefiting from collaboration. We ran a crowdsourced study in which two factors were varied: whether participants could asynchronously collaborate via access to solutions previously provided by other participants, and whether participants had access to quality-diversity search tools.

We include transform nodes, which apply transformations to other nodes in the behavior tree, allowing more complex mechanics to be expressed in a compact way.

As a potential solution, some game developers look to narrative as an experience-enhancing feature. Yet the impacts and affordances of narrative in citizen science games remain understudied, especially for games that require significant onboarding. Therefore, we investigated the effects of wrapping a story around the tutorial puzzles of the citizen science game Foldit. We found that the narrative increased the time players spent engaging with the game’s tutorial and its scientific puzzles but did not substantially affect their progress through the tutorial. This article provides two major contributions: (1) empirical evidence detailing the impact of narrative on gameplay metrics in a citizen science game, including the relevant effects of genre preferences on engagement; and (2) recommendations on the use of narrative and its capacities in citizen science games. We conclude that the inclusion of a narrative can add valuable depth to the experience when designed thoughtfully and intentionally.",927

In this work, we present a constraint-based approach to level generation for 2D tile-based games that simultaneously generates a level and an example playthrough of the level demonstrating its completability. The approach represents game mechanics as tile rewrite rules, which allows a variety of games and mechanics (beyond simple pathfinding) to be incorporated. The mechanics are represented as constraints in the same problem along with the constraints used to generate the level itself. Thus, the solution to the constraint problem contains both a level and a playthrough of the level. We demonstrate the flexibilty of the system and of tile rewrite rules in several applications, including lock-and-key dungeons, platformers, puzzles, and match-three style games.",928

In this work, we present a constraint-based approach for graph generation that learns local neighborhood patterns (in the form of labeled nodes and edges) from example graphs. This allows the approach to generate graphs with varying structures that are still locally similar to the examples. We demonstrate the approach on several applications, such as abstract graphs describing Legend of Zelda dungeons. Additionally, using Super Mario Bros. levels, we show how techniques that run on a grid may be considered a special case of graph generation where each tile is a node connecting to its neighboring tiles’ nodes.",929

Using TRRBTs, a game’s state is represented as a grid of tiles, the behavior trees describe the overall flow of the game, and the rewrite rules at leaf nodes describe changes in game state. We include transform nodes, which apply transformations to other nodes in the behavior tree, allowing more complex mechanics to be expressed in a compact way.

This paper reports on an exploratory design study investigating how social technology might facilitate uncertainty reduction through three “provotypes” - provocative prototypes of user-generated speculative design concepts. U.S.-based participants engaged with the provotypes through an interactive fiction to explore their usefulness in the context of a racist microaggression. Results showed that engaging the provotypes through interactive fiction facilitated complex and productive interactions and critiques. This work contributes a novel method for conducting exploratory design, remote user studies using interactive fiction as well as priorities, tensions, and further information what role, if any, technology might play in managing racist interactions.",952

The long-term goal of this work is to understand how CSCW researchers and designers could best support members of marginalized groups to make sense of and to seek support for experiences with racism. Narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. For example, participants' personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. In addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. We discuss how participants' accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who ""gets it"" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups.",956

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations.",957

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data.",959

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models.

Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.",962

The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",964

Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust.

Algorithmic pluralism describes a state of affairs in which no set of algorithms severely limits access to opportunity, allowing individuals the freedom to pursue a diverse range of life paths. To argue for algorithmic pluralism, we adopt Joseph Fishkin’s theory of bottlenecks, which focuses on the structure of decision-points that determine how opportunities are allocated. The theory contends that each decision-point or “bottleneck’’ limits access to opportunities with some degree of severity and legitimacy. We extend Fishkin’s structural viewpoint and use it to reframe existing systemic concerns about equal opportunity in algorithmic decision-making, such as patterned inequality and algorithmic monoculture. In proposing algorithmic pluralism, we argue for the urgent priority of alleviating severe bottlenecks in algorithmic-decision-making. We contend that there must be a pluralism of opportunity available to many different individuals in order to promote equal opportunity in a systemic way. We further show how this framework has several implications for system design and regulation through current debates about equal opportunity in algorithmic hiring.",979

In practice, the societal impact of machine learning is determined by the surrounding context of machine learning deployments. To capture this, we introduce ecosystem-level analysis: rather than analyzing a single model, we consider the collection of models that are deployed in a given context. For example, ecosystem-level analysis in hiring recognizes that a job candidate's outcomes are not only determined by a single hiring algorithm or firm but instead by the collective decisions of all the firms they applied to. Across three modalities (text, images, speech) and 11 datasets, we establish a clear trend: deployed machine learning is prone to systemic failure, meaning some users are exclusively misclassified by all models available. Even when individual models improve at the population level over time, we find these improvements rarely reduce the prevalence of systemic failure. Instead, the benefits of these improvements predominantly accrue to individuals who are already correctly classified by other models. In light of these trends, we consider medical imaging for dermatology where the costs of systemic failure are especially high. While traditional analyses reveal racial performance disparities for both models and humans, ecosystem-level analysis reveals new forms of racial disparity in model predictions that do not present in human predictions. These examples demonstrate ecosystem-level analysis has unique strengths for characterizing the societal impact of machine learning.",981

While sharing offers clear advantages (e.g. amortizing costs), does it bear risks? We introduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to which particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all decision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience undesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and reinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome homogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers share components like training data or specific models, then they will produce more homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness benchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates homogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level effects. Further, given the dominant paradigm in AI of foundation models, i.e. models that can be adapted for myriad downstream tasks, we test whether model sharing homogenizes outcomes across tasks. We observe mixed results: we find that for both vision and language settings, the specific methods for adapting a foundation model significantly influence the degree of outcome homogenization.

We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties.

Interact., 8, 1-28. https://doi.org/10.1145/3687062","Social computing scholars have long known that people do not interact with knowledge in straightforward ways, especially in digital environments. While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional, often non-Western, ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards epistemic justice. In sum, we recount, synthesize, and propose solutions for the various forms of epistemic injustice that CSCW sites of study---including CSCW itself---propagate.",994

We present results of a qualitative content analysis of the quantitative data used in 337 blog posts published by five pairs of conservative and liberal advocacy organizations over the course of the month leading up to the 2016 US elections. We identify key data rhetoric practices along partisan lines and contribute an analytic framework-evaluating ethos, pathos, and logos- that can be used to analyze the rhetorical use of data in other contexts. We then characterize two different imaginaries that come into conflict in this research: 1) the political imaginaries being promoted through organizational blogging and 2) the sociotechnical imaginary of the data economy, foregrounding differences in the epistemic value of data in each. We conclude by outlining research challenges and trajectories for future research within each of the two imaginaries of data.",996

Their choices play into broader political tensions; social media platforms are situated within a social context that frames their impact, and they can have politics through their design that enforce power structures and serve existing authorities. We turn to Pillowfort, a small social media platform, to examine these political tensions as a case study. Using a discourse analysis, we examine public discussion posts between staff and users as they negotiate the site's development over a period of two years. Our findings illustrate the tensions in navigating the politics that users bring with them from previous platforms, the difficulty of building a site's unique identity and encouraging commitment, and examples of how design decisions can both foster and break trust with users.

(2019) Fake News is Counterfeit News. Inquiry. doi:10.1080/0020174X.2019.1688179","References ABSTRACT Fake news poses a serious threat to knowledge and democracy. In order to address this threat, it is important to understand exactly what fake news is. After surveying the various definitions that have been proposed in the philosophical literature, we argue that fake news is best understood as counterfeit news . A story is genuine news if and only if it has gone through the standard modern journalistic process involving professionally trained reporters, fact checkers, and editors. And a story is counterfeit news if and only if it is not genuine news, but is presented as genuine news, with the intention and propensity to deceive. This analysis is a contribution to ‘systems-oriented social epistemology’ (Goldman, Alvin I. 2011. “A Guide to Social Epistemology.” In Social Epistemology: Essential Readings , edited by Alvin I. Goldman, and Dennis Whitcomb, 11–37. New York: Oxford University Press). Various social institutions, such as science and journalism, provide important epistemic benefits to society. But unscrupulous agents are often motivated to leverage the epistemic authority of these institutions by counterfeiting them. People can thereby be misled and/or lose faith in these institutions. Thus, society may suffer significant epistemic costs when such counterfeits proliferate. ABSTRACT KEYWORDS: Fake news deception conceptual analysis social epistemology counterfeits",1001

Facial expressions are a sensitive, specific biomarker of the presence and severity of pain, and computer vision (CV) and machine-learning (ML) techniques enable reliable, valid measurement of pain-related facial expressions from video. We developed and evaluated a CVML approach to measure pain-related facial expressions for automated pain assessment in youth. Methods: A CVML-based model for assessment of pediatric postoperative pain was developed from videos of 50 neurotypical youth 5 to 18 years old in both endogenous/ongoing and exogenous/transient pain conditions after laparoscopic appendectomy. Model accuracy was assessed for self-reported pain ratings in children and time since surgery, and compared with by-proxy parent and nurse estimates of observed pain in youth. Results: Model detection of pain versus no-pain demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84-0.94) in both ongoing and transient pain conditions. Model detection of pain severity demonstrated moderate-to-strong correlations (r = 0.65-0.86 within; r = 0.47-0.61 across subjects) for both pain conditions. The model performed equivalently to nurses but not as well as parents in detecting pain versus no-pain conditions, but performed equivalently to parents in estimating pain severity. Nurses were more likely than the model to underestimate youth self-reported pain ratings. Demographic factors did not affect model performance. Conclusions: CVML pain assessment models derived from automatic facial expression measurements demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy in binary pain classifications, strong correlations with patient self-reported pain ratings, and parent-equivalent estimation of children's pain levels over typical pain trajectories in youth after appendectomy.",1012

DOI: 10.1145/3491102.3517436","Tactile maps can help people who are blind or have low-vision navigate and familiarize themselves with unfamiliar locations. Ideally, tactile maps can be customized to an individual’s unique needs and abilities because of their limited space for representation. We present Maptimizer, a tool that generates tactile maps based on users’ preferences and requirements. Maptimizer uses a two stage optimization process to pair representations with geographic information and tune those representations to present that information more clearly. In a small user study, Maptimizer helped participants more successfully and efficiently identify locations of interest in unknown areas. These results demonstrate the utility of optimization techniques and generative design in complex accessibility domains.",1016

To achieve this, the community had to balance their clinical value of safety with the maker value of broadened participation in design and production. We analyse their struggles and achievement through the artifacts they produced and the labors of key facilitators between diverse community members. Based on this analysis we provide insights into how medical maker communities, which are necessarily risk-averse and safety-oriented, can still support makers' grassroots efforts to care for their communities. Based on these findings, we recommend that design tools enable adaptation to a wider set of domains, rather than exclusively presenting information relevant to manufacturing. Further, we call for future work on the portability of designs across different types of printers which could enable broader participation in future maker efforts at this scale.",1017

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations.",1018

We propose a method that reduces the length of each EMA question set measuring interrelated constructs, with only modest information loss. By estimating the potential information gain of each EMA question using question-answer prediction models, this method can prioritize the presentation of the most informative question in a question-by-question sequence and skip uninformative questions. We evaluated the proposed method by simulating question omission using four real-world datasets from three different EMA studies. When compared against the random question omission approach that skips 50% of the questions, our method reduces imputation errors by 15%-52%. In surveys with five answer options for each question, our method can reduce the mean survey length by 34%-56% with a real-time prediction accuracy of 72%-95% for the skipped questions.

We introduce an alternative and novel form of micro-interaction self-report using speech input - audio-μEMA- where a short beep or vibration cues participants to verbally report their behavioral states, allowing for open-ended, temporally dense self-reports. We conducted a one-hour usability study followed by a within-subject, 6-day to 21-day free-living feasibility study in which participants self-reported their physical activities and postures once every 2 to 5 minutes.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time.

We examined the contextual biases associated with non-response of μEMA prompts on a smartwatch. Based on prior work on EMA non-response and smartwatch use, we identified 10 potential contextual biases from three categories: temporal (time of the day, parts of waking day, day of the week, and days in study), device use (screen state, charging status, battery mode, and phone usage), and activity (wrist motion and location). We used data from a longitudinal study where 131 participants (Mean age 22.9 years, SD = 3.0) responded to μEMA surveys on a smartwatch for at least six months.

EMA has a key limitation: interruption burden. Microinteraction-EMA(µEMA) may reduce burden without sacrificing high temporal density of measurement. In µEMA, all EMA prompts can be answered with ‘at a glance' microinteractions. In a prior 4-week pilot study comparing standard EMA delivered on a phone (phone-EMA) vs. µEMA delivered on a smartwatch (watch-µEMA), watch-µEMA demonstrated higher response rates and lower perceived burden than phone-EMA, even when the watch-µEMA interruption rate was 8 times more than phone-EMA. A new 4-week dataset was gathered on smartwatch-based EMA (i.e., watch-EMA with 6 back-to-back, multiple-choice questions on a watch) to compare whether the high response rates of watch-µEMA previously observed were a result of using microinteractions, or due to the novelty and accessibility of the smartwatch. No statistically significant differences in compliance, completion, and first-prompt response rates were observed between phone-EMA and watch-EMA. However, watch-µEMA response rates were significantly higher than watch-EMA. This pilot suggests that (1) the high compliance and low burden previously observed in watch-µEMA is likely due to the microinteraction question technique, not simply the use of the watch versus the phone, and that (2) compliance with traditional EMA (with long surveys) may not improve simply by moving survey delivery from the phone to a smartwatch.",1028

However, little is known about the experience of sharing AR narratives with others. Much of our current understanding is derived from multi-user VR applications, which can differ significantly in presence, social interaction, and spatial awareness from narratives and other entertainment content designed for AR head-worn displays. To understand the dynamics of multi-user, co-located, AR storytelling, we conducted an exploratory study involving three original AR narratives. Participants experienced each narrative alone or in pairs via the Microsoft Hololens 2. We collected qualitative and quantitative data from 42 participants through questionnaires and post-experience semi-structured interviews. Results indicate participants enjoyed experiencing AR narratives together and revealed five themes relevant to the design of multi-user, co-located AR narratives. We discuss the implications of these themes and provide design recommendations for AR experience designers and storytellers regarding the impact of interaction, physical space, spatial coherence, and narrative timing.

We then run a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate whether users can accurately define these technical terms, to identify commonly held misconceptions, and to investigate how the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with privacy policies. We find that technical terms are broadly misunderstood and that particular misconceptions are common. We also find that the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with various privacy policies and their reported likeliness to accept those policies.

Therefore, a critical social skill for these agents is Theory of Mind (ToM): the ability to model and reason about other agents. Research has investigated ToM in LLMs using standard, modified, and extended versions of false-belief tasks. These tests include explicit prompts asking LLMs to answer questions about other agents. However, in real situations, people have to use ToM unprompted to navigate social life. Additionally, oftentimes, people have to rely on nonverbal cues such as facial expressions. This work seeks to address this gap by studying implicit ToM in LLMs in a negotiation task. In negotiation, agents have to implicitly reason about other agents to reach an agreed-upon best possible deal. We conducted the negotiation experiment by prompting different LLMs to roleplay as characters and pitting them against rule-based agents that may respond with different facial expressions. We measure and compare the outcomes of the negotiation across models.

Constraint-based generators ensure that certain properties hold in each design they output. However, when deployed a general-purpose solver is often required, thus guarantees come with unpredictable search times and little control over sequentially-generated outputs. In this paper, we outline how we can encode design constraints into a compact circuit representation that affords generation without search. These generators yield samples that are distributed uniformly over the space of valid designs. We illustrate our approach with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) in comparison to the traditional approach with answer-set programming (ASP) in two scenarios: a grid-based tile placement scenario inspired by WaveFunctionCollapse, and a playable platformer level design scenario. These compiled design-space models make constraint-based methods easier to deploy by improving on both the running time and diversity of previous constraint-based methods.",1060

The former shows promise by automating the specification of quality criteria through latent patterns in data, while the latter offers significant advantages for authorial control. In this paper we propose the use of probabilistic logic as a unifying framework that combines the benefits of both methodologies. We propose a Bayesian formalization of content generators as probability distributions and show how common PCG tasks map naturally to operations on the distribution. Further, through a series of experiments with maze generation, we demonstrate how probabilistic logic semantics allows us to leverage the authorial control of declarative programming and the flexibility of learning from data.",1061

In supply chains, multiple decision-makers act on uncertain information they receive from others, often leading to sub-optimal decisions that propagate the effects of supply chain disruptions to other stakeholders. Therefore, understanding how humans learn to interpret information from others and how it influences their decision-making is key to alleviating supply chain shortages. In this work, we investigated how downstream supply chain echelons, health centers in pharmaceutical supply chains, interpret and use manufacturers' estimated resupply date (ERD) information during drug shortages. We formulated a computational model of a health center based on a partially observable Markov decision process that learns a manufacturer's information sharing tendencies through an observation function. To investigate the model and important factors influencing decisions and perceptions of ERD, we conducted a human experiment to study where subjects played the role of a health center during a drug shortage. They received ERDs from a manufacturer on a weekly basis and decided whether or not to switch to an alternative product (and pay additional costs) to avoid running out of stock. The results show that different manufacturers' sequences of ERDs and the accuracy of ERDs could impact subjects' decisions, beliefs, performance, and perception of the manufacturer. We also found that the subjective belief of ERDs is the best predictor of subjects' switching decisions. Lastly, we fit the observation function's learning rate and show that the model can predict subjects' decisions better than other baseline models in most conditions.",1062

Our agent does not directly observe or model the environment or the people in it, but instead relies on input from analytic components (ACs) (developed by other research teams) that process environmental information and output only teamwork-relevant measures. Our agent models these teamwork variables and updates its beliefs over them using a Bayesian Theory of Mind [1], applying Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) [9] in a recursive manner to assess the state of the team it is currently observing and to choose interventions to best assist them.",1063

Modeling and being able to predict people's behavior in such situations, how they cope, is a critical research topic. To that end, we propose a computational model of coping that casts Lazarus' theory of coping into a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. This includes an appraisal process that models the factors that lead to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models people's behavior in the face of such stress. This coping process includes problem-focused coping, whereby people seek to alter the external environment, and emotion-focused coping, whereby people alter their internal beliefs, goals, and intentions in the face of stress. We evaluate the model's assumptions and predictions in the context of a high-stress situation that is increasingly common, the extreme conditions of a hurricane. We collected human survey data from the last several years of major U.S. hurricanes to evaluate the features in the models used for appraisal calculation. Additionally, we conducted a controlled human-subject experiment simulating a hurricane experience to investigate the prediction of the model on how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation. The results show that, as predicted by the model, the proposed model features are significantly associated with the evacuation decisions and post-decision people also change their beliefs and goals in the directions that align with their prior decisions. Lastly, we conduct a simulation study showing that the proposed model is qualitatively closer to the experiment data than the baseline models that do not incorporate coping effects.",1069

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables.

However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is slow, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of this workshop for the last five years, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in developing a holistic approach for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health.",1081

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3448116","Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that ""negated"" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such ""negative"" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers.",1082

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3432220","Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-the-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress. There is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions.",1083

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights.

In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with university students to understand the unique challenges in the mental health medication management process and their coping strategies, particularly examining the role of various technologies in this process. We discovered that due to struggles with self-acceptance and the interdependent relationship between medication, symptoms, schedules, and life changes, the medication management process for students was a highly dynamic journey involving frequent dosage changes. Thus, students adopted flexible strategies of using minimal technology to manage their medication in different situations while maintaining a high degree of autonomy.

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries.

However, those who encountered weaknesses earlier made significantly fewer errors, since they tended to rely more on themselves, while they also underestimated model competencies due to having a more negative first impression of the model. Motivated by these findings and similar existing work, we formalize and present a conceptual model of user’s past experiences that examine the relations between user’s backgrounds, experiences, and human factors in XAI systems based on usage time. Our work presents strong findings and implications, aiming to raise the awareness of AI designers toward biases associated with user impressions and backgrounds.",1101

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",1105

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3476060","Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was3.76.But,weestimatedthatcrowdworkersinourstudyspent332.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing.",1131

We uncover that workers pushed for marketplaces that either empowered workers to set their own salaries without requiring a minimum wage or had intelligent algorithms that could automatically decide the salaries while also ensuring everyone received a minimum wage. Requesters were consistent in their preference of paying by commission and preferred markets that automatically set the salary. Both workers and requesters advocated for mechanisms to ensure quality and flexible time schedules in the market. We conclude by discussing design implications from our findings.",1132

One reason for this is that it is difficult for workers to accurately gauge the hourly wages of microtasks, and they consequently end up performing labor with little pay. In general, workers are provided with little information about tasks, and are left to rely on noisy signals, such as textual description of the task or rating of the requester. This study explores various computational methods for predicting the working times (and thus hourly wages) required for tasks based on data collected from other workers completing crowd work. We provide the following contributions. (i) A data collection method for gathering real-world training data on crowd-work tasks and the times required for workers to complete them; (ii) TurkScanner: a machine learning approach that predicts the necessary working time to complete a task (and can thus implicitly provide the expected hourly wage). We collected 9,155 data records using a web browser extension installed by 84 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and explored the challenge of accurately recording working times both automatically and by asking workers. TurkScanner was created using ~ 150 derived features, and was able to predict the hourly wages of 69.6% of all the tested microtasks within a 75% error. Directions for future research include observing the effects of tools on people's working practices, adapting this approach to a requester tool for better price setting, and predicting other elements of work (e.g., the acceptance likelihood and worker task preferences.)",1133

Building on the theory's original tenets, we argue that racism is pervasive in everyday socio-technical systems; that the HCI community is prone to ""interest convergence"", where concessions to inclusion require benefits to those in power; and that the neoliberal underpinnings of the technology industry itself propagate racism. Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deep-seated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI. The implications: all HCI research must be attuned to issues of race; participation of underrepresented minorities must be sought in all of our activities; and as a community, we cannot become comfortable while racial disparities exist.",1147

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",1148

IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, (2021).","Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and ""get their hands on"" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.",1152

Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Hammurabi into Firefox and the Go language in less than 100 lines of code each.",1155

In this study, we begin the process of investigating whether websites are complying with the CCPA by focusing on DNSMPI links. Using longitudinal data crawled from the top 1M websites in the Tranco ranking, we examine which websites are including DNSMPI links, whether the websites without DNSMPI links are out of compliance with the law, whether websites are using geofences to dynamically hide DNSMPI links from nonCalifornians, how DNSMPI adoption has changed over time, and how websites are choosing to present DNSMPI links (e.g., in terms of font size, color, and placement). We argue that the answers to these questions are critical for spurring enforcement actions under the law, and helping to shape future privacy laws and regulations, e.g., rule making that will soon commence around the successor to the CCPA, known as the CPRA.",1156

This paper aims to structurize these misinformation stories by leveraging fact-check articles. Our intuition is that key phrases in a fact-check article that identify the misinformation type(s) (e.g., doctored images, urban legends) also act as rationales that determine the verdict of the fact-check (e.g., false). We experiment on rationalized models with domain knowledge as weak supervision to extract these phrases as rationales, and then cluster semantically similar rationales to summarize prevalent misinformation types. Using archived fact-checks from Snopes.com, we identify ten types of misinformation stories. We discuss how these types have evolved over the last ten years and compare their prevalence between the 2016/2020 US presidential elections and the H1N1/COVID-19 pandemics.",1160

These consequences are framed under the public's susceptibility to such misinformation — a narrative that needs further investigation and quantification. To this end, our paper proposes an observational approach to model and measure expressed (dis)beliefs in (mis)information by leveraging social media comments as a proxy. We collect a sample of tweets in response to (mis)information and annotate them with (dis)belief labels, explore the dataset using lexicon-based methods, and finally build classifiers based on the state-of-the-art neural transfer-learning models (BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa). Under a domain-specific thresholding strategy for unbiasedness, the best-performing classifier archives macro-F 1 scores around 0.86 for disbelief and 0.80 for belief. Applying the classifier, we conduct a large-scale measurement study and show that, for true/mixed/false claims on social media, 12%/14%/15% of comments express disbelief and 26%/21%/20% of comments express belief. In addition, our results suggest an extremely slight time effect of falsehood awareness, a positive effect of fact-checks to false claims, and differences in (dis)belief across social media platforms.",1161

To mitigate domain spoofing, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab introduced the ads.txt standard in May 2017 to help ad buyers verify authorized digital ad sellers, as well as to promote overall transparency in programmatic advertising. In this work, we present a 15-month longitudinal, observational study of the ads.txt standard. We do this to understand (1) if it is helping ad buyers to combat domain spoofing and (2) whether the transparency offered by the standard can provide useful data to researchers and privacy advocates. With respect to halting domain spoofing, we observe that over 60% of Alexa Top-100K publishers that run RTB ads have adopted ads.txt, and that ad exchanges and advertisers appear to be honoring the standard. With respect to transparency, the widespread adoption of ads.txt allows us to explicitly identify over 1,000 domains belonging to ad exchanges, without having to rely on crowdsourcing or heuristic methods. However, we also find that ads.txt is still a long way from reaching its full potential. Many publishers have yet to adopt the standard, and we observe major ad exchanges purchasing unauthorized impressions that violate the standard. This opens the door to domain spoofing attacks. Further, ads.txt data often include errors that must be cleaned and mitigated before the data is practically useful.",1162

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data.",1166

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.",1167

Effective clinical decision-making, including the detection of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and the monitoring of associated symptoms, remains a challenging task for clinicians. This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making.",1168

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.",1169

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",1171

This led to a comparison among four conditions: controller input using 2D keys, controller input using 3D keys, hand-tracking input using 2D keys, hand-tracking input using 3D keys. Results from our user study (n = 28) revealed that controller input (15.3 WPM) outperformed hand-tracking input (13.8 WPM) in terms of text entry rates and that protruded 3D keys (15.6 WPM) led to faster text entry performance than did flat 2D keys (13.4 WPM). While the four conditions did not differ in error rates, flat 2D keys led to a greater number of character corrections. In addition, results showed that compared to flat 2D keys, protruded 3D keys lowered the perceived mental workload of the text entry task. These results indicate that despite the technological advances in hand-tracking technology, controller input is still more performant than hand-tracking input for VR text entry tasks and that protruded 3D keys afford faster text entry and better user experience than do flat 2D keys.

However, little is known about how these warnings should be structured to maximize effectiveness in helping with people PSE navigate visual media safely. The design space for photosensitivity warnings is vast and includes questions such as what details to include about strobing light sequences or the content itself, where to place warnings within an interface, and what methods to use to extract information about the strobing light sequences (e.g., crowdsourced or automated methods). In this work, we contribute a thematic analysis of crowdsourced warnings drawn from the DoesTheDogDie online forum and an interview study with five people who have been diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy about design considerations for photosensitivity warnings on digital platforms. To guide our interviews, we assembled examples of both crowdsourced and automated warnings about seizure-inducing content in films.

When each tool was used in isolation, AI-only conditions scored significantly lower in both user enjoyment and comprehension. When used in tandem, AI-only conditions matched outcomes delivered with human-in-the-loop, which suggests that AI-only AD tools may be most effective when both types of tools are used in tandem. A multimodal analysis of interactions with the tandem system revealed areas for system improvement in terms of the timing of AD delivery and accurate content delivery. We discuss how the use of both types of tools in a tandem system can mitigate some of the digital frictions that have plagued efforts in machine learning and automated tools for accessibility.",1187

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return.",1188

Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning ICML, 6818-6835. https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/daley23a.html","Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across λ λ -values in an off-policy control task.",1191

State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are related to the effectiveness of different types of critics.",1192

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B.

To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another.

Detecting Depressive Tendencies using Transformer-based Multimodal Frameworks MLNLP, 360-365. https://doi.org/10.1145/3578741.3578817",One of the most common mental illnesses that affects 5% of adults globally is depression. The advancement of social media has meant that more and more people have gained a platform to voice their thoughts and beliefs. People’s social media interactions and posted content can be used to infer critical characteristics such as depressive tendencies which will allow for timely intervention and help. This paper describes a novel supervised approach to detect depressive tendencies in Twitter users using multimodal frameworks which account for user interaction and online behaviour in addition to the tweet content processed using transformers like BERT. The performance of three multimodal frameworks is described with different methods for combining modalities. The best result is obtained a cross-modality based model which improves the baseline by 12% points.,1213

Moreover, the features that belong to each group, and the important feature groups may vary per sample. But what do we mean by feature redundancy? In this paper, we formally define two types of redundancies using information theory: \textit{Representation} and \textit{Relevant redundancies}. We leverage these redundancies to design a formulation for instance-wise feature group discovery and reveal a theoretical guideline to help discover the appropriate number of groups. We approximate mutual information via a variational lower bound and learn the feature group and selector indicators with Gumbel-Softmax in optimizing our formulation. Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical claims. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and gene expression datasets show that our method discovers feature groups with high classification accuracies.",1220

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for each and offer in-depth discussions for future research on hypergraph mining.",1234

An adversary that can manipulate the graph structure could alter traffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing traffic to a toll road). This article presents the Force Path Cut problem, in which an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the shortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that the optimization version of this problem is APX-hard but introduce PATHATTACK , a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path. We derive a nonconvex optimization formulation for these problems and derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We demonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic networks, illustrating where the proposed algorithms provide the greatest improvement over baseline methods.",1236

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political.",1239

Defense Against Shortest Path Attacks CoRR, abs/2305.19083. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.19083","Identifying shortest paths between nodes in a network is an important task in applications involving routing of resources. Recent work has shown that a malicious actor can manipulate a graph to make traffic between two nodes of interest follow their target path. In this paper, we develop a defense against such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose heuristic solutions based on increasing edge weights along target paths in both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum settings. Relaxing some constraints of the original problem, we formulate a linear program for local optimization around a feasible point. We present defense results with both synthetic and real network datasets and show that these methods often reach the lower bound of the defender's cost.",1240

The assembly of active molecules might have promoted the formation of large pre-biotic polymers that could be the precursors of the informational polymers we observe nowadays. Numerical simulations clearly show that self-propulsion considerably speeds up the assembly of polymers, somewhat in agreement with previous related studies. We conclude by discussing the differences between self-Assembly and self-Organization and discuss the role of self-propelled particles in the development of the self-organized system.

In the U.S. call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255. We show how a model that borrows some of these ideas can be used to study polymer formation from a collection of self-propelled monomers. We will not attempt to provide a theoretical description of the active self-assembly process presented here. Instead, we will present only numerical results obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. The motivation for studying the channel system is based on the hypothesis that the formation of organic macro-molecules relevant to the origin of life may have occurred in micro-channels formed either in meteorites [ 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ] or in confined micro-spaces of marine vent chimneys in which molecules are driven by thermal gradients. The results show that the external input of energy, via self-propulsion or other sources (such as ATP), can considerably enhance the assembly of structures. Propulsion considerably improves theassembly of molecules as compared to spontaneous self-assembly. At high temperatures, mostly monomers and dimers coexist, whereas longer polymer appear in negligible amounts. At low temperatures, the average polymer length does not reach a maximum at any value of the self-propulsion force. This is due to the aggregation of molecules and polymers next to the repulsive channel walls, which decreases the rate at which the chains grow. In the high-temperature regime, the system reaches a stationary state within the simulation time. In every case reported in Figure 4 , it can be seen that increasing 𝐹 sp F sp increases the growth rate of the polymer chains. The tail of the distribution reveals that much longer polymers are created. The narrower the channel, the less self- Propulsion force is needed to create long polymers. This effect clearly becomes stronger for narrow channels. The aggregation and jammingof active particles next to the confining Walls has been observed in both numerical simulations and experiments. Self-propulsion could have been an important mechanism for the formation of pre-biotic structures or the synthesis of nanometric structures. The model we have introduced takes into account the full geometry of the molecules by discretizing them into subunits. All authors have read and agree to the published version of the manuscript.

Beta regression is then introduced to do the probabilistic modeling, which is demonstrated to function well in comprehensive experiments.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present our HABERTOR model for detecting hatespeech in large scale user-generated content. Inspired by the recent success of the BERT model, we propose several modifications to BERT to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification task. HABERTOR inherits BERT’s architecture, but is different in four aspects: (i) it generates its own vocabularies and is pre-trained from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech dataset; (ii) it consists of Quaternion-based factorized components, resulting in a much smaller number of parameters, faster training and inferencing, as well as less memory usage; (iii) it uses our proposed multi-source ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input sources, to further enhance its effectiveness; and (iv) it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed fine-grained and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its robustness. Through experiments on the large-scale real-world hatespeech dataset with 1.4M annotated comments, we show that HABERTOR works better than 15 state-of-the-art hatespeech detection methods, including fine-tuning Language Models. In particular, comparing with BERT, our HABERTOR is 4 5 times faster in the training/inferencing phase, uses less than 1/3 of the memory, and has better performance, even though we pre-train it by using less than 1% of the number of words. Our generalizability analysis shows that HABERTOR transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to BERT for the hatespeech classification.",1248

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract The neural attention mechanism plays an important role in many natural language processing applications. In particular, multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. However, without explicit constraining, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model’s representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective. Based on the recently developed particle-optimization sampling techniques, we propose a non-parametric approach that explicitly improves the repulsiveness in multi-head attention and consequently strengthens model’s expressiveness. Remarkably, our Bayesian interpretation provides theoretical inspirations on the not-well-understood questions: why and how one uses multi-head attention. Extensive experiments on various attention models and applications demonstrate that the proposed repulsive attention can improve the learned feature diversity, leading to more informative representations with consistent performance improvement on multiple tasks.",1249

Furthermore, the normalization involves the prediction of both operation types and token labels, enabling TNT to learn from more challenging tasks than the standard task of masked word recovery. As a result, the experiments demonstrate that TNT outperforms strong baselines on the hate speech classification task. Additional text normalization experiments and case studies show that TNT is a new potential approach to misspelling correction.",1250

As grid features make the model design and training process much simpler, this enables us to train them end-to-end and also use a more flexible network design.

We automatically obtain labels on the target data by using high-confidence detections from the existing detector, augmented with hard (misclassified) examples acquired by exploiting temporal cues using a tracker. These automatically-obtained labels are then used for re-training the original model. A modified knowledge distillation loss is proposed, and we investigate several ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain. Our approach is empirically evaluated on challenging face and pedestrian detection tasks: a face detector trained on WIDER-Face, which consists of high-quality images crawled from the web, is adapted to a large-scale surveillance data set; a pedestrian detector trained on clear, daytime images from the BDD-100K driving data set is adapted to all other scenarios such as rainy, foggy, night-time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating hard examples obtained from tracking, the advantage of using soft-labels via distillation loss versus hard-labels, and show promising performance as a simple method for unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors, with minimal dependence on hyper-parameters.",1260

Existing algorithms for this problem either incur sub-optimal error or have high communication and/or run-time complexity. We propose a new algorithmic framework, namely ProjUnit, for private mean estimation that yields algorithms that are computationally efficient, have low communication complexity, and incur optimal error up to a 1 + o ( 1 ) 1 + o ( 1 ) -factor. Our framework is deceptively simple: each randomizer projects its input to a random low-dimensional subspace and then runs an optimal algorithm such a PrivUnitG in the lower dimensional space. We analyze the error of the algorithm in terms of properties of the random projection ensemble, and study two instantiations. We conduct several experiments for private mean estimation and private federated learning which demonstrate that our algorithms obtain nearly the same utility as optimal algorithms while having significantly lower communication and computational cost.

Extensive work has been done on privately maximizing submodular functions in the general case when the function depends upon the private data of individuals. However, when the size of the data stream drawn from the domain of the objective function is large or arrives very fast, one must privately optimize the objective within the constraints of the streaming setting. We establish fundamental differentially private baselines for this problem and then derive better trade-offs between privacy and utility for the special case of decomposable submodular functions. A submodular function is decomposable when it can be written as a sum of submodular functions; this structure arises naturally when each summand function models the utility of an individual and the goal is to study the total utility of the whole population as in the well-known Combinatorial Public Projects Problem. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis with experimental corroboration.",1264

Our algorithms automatically adapt to unknown problem parameters such as the smoothness and the norm of the operator, and the variance of the stochastic evaluation oracle. We show that our algorithms are universal and simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates in the non-smooth, smooth, and stochastic settings. The convergence guarantees of our algorithms improve over existing adaptive methods and match the optimal non-adaptive algorithms. Additionally, prior works require that the optimization domain is bounded. In this work, we remove this restriction and give algorithms for unbounded domains that are adaptive and universal. Our general proof techniques can be used for many variants of the algorithm using one or two operator evaluations per iteration. The classical methods based on the ExtraGradient/MirrorProx algorithm require two operator evaluations per iteration, which is the dominant factor in the running time in many settings.",1265

In this work, we develop a new streaming algorithm for maximizing a monotone k-submodular function subject to a per-coordinate cardinality constraint attaining an approximation guarantee close to the state of the art guarantee in the offline setting. Though not typical for streaming algorithms, our streaming algorithm also readily applies to the online setting with free disposal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and enjoys fast running time and small number of function evaluations. Furthermore, its guarantee improves as the cardinality constraints get larger, which is especially suited for the large scale applications.

In many practical settings this is a significant improvement over the O (n+k^2) computation cost that is achieved by the recent PI-RAPPOR algorithm (Feldman and Talwar; 2021).

In fact, even more specifically, they are all linear sketches. We prove the first non-trivial update time lower bounds for both randomized and deterministic turnstile streaming algorithms, which hold when the algorithms are non-adaptive. While there has been abundant success in proving space lower bounds, there have been no non-trivial turnstile update time lower bounds.

Diversity Measures for Niching Algorithms. Journal of Algorithms, Vol 14, Issue 2.","Swarm diversity measures can be used to quantify spread in niching algorithms. Niches are formed by a cluster of candidate solutions. A candidate niche can still be refined to find an actual solution, or optimum. An averaged candidate Niches’ diversity (SD diversity per niche) corresponds to the intra-niche distances. This article belongs to the Special Issue Benchmarking, Selecting and Configuring Learning and Optimization Algorithms. It is available as an Open Access PDF and can be read in the following formats: PDF with Cover, Epub, or PDF with Keyboard and Arrow, as well as the usual print and e-book formats. The adapted SDNN is shown in Appendix A , Appendix B and Appendix C. The results of the experiments are presented in Section 5.1. The average distance around the swarm centre (ADSC) computes the swarm diversity by calculating the average distance of particles to a central point in each dimension. A high SDNN value means that particles in a niche are far from each other. Low SDNN values may not indicate niche convergence because the calculated distance is only with respect to NNs and not entire members of a candidate niche. In the work presented here, the entropy measure value was normalised between 0 and 1. In this case, 1 represents high diversity while 0 represents no diversity. The work reported here, was calculated per niche, then averaged. 2.1.6 Solow–Polasky Diversity measure (SPD) The SPD measure relies on the use of the inverse of the matrix, M . The swarm center and the swarm coherence is similar to ADSC with the only exception that a further normalisation is carried out. Each candidate niche contains a neighbourhood best (i.e., the best candidate in a niche) Niche diversity refers to diversity with respect to the neighbourhood bests in each of the identified candidate niches. A good niching algorithm is expected to have a considerable high diversity both at the exploration and exploitation phases of the search process. However, niche diversity is still affected by such drawbacks as ‘outliers’ and niche identification strategies. The results for all the considered multimodal problems show that the diversity quantified using the standard SD is high. In conclusion, the standardSD is not suitable for niched algorithms. Diversity is not measured on how far apart the solutions are from each other but from the ‘swarm best’ which are multiple. As the particles converge towards optima, the diversity will decrease and then stagnate at a relatively high diversity value. The results of the study were published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, San Diego, on November 14, 2013. The embargo on this article has been lifted at the request of the author. The work presented here postulates that entropy is a suitable measure for quantifying dispersion for solutions and candidate solutions of niching algorithms. In summary, the nADAA is a useful measure to quantify the spread. of the solutions. of nICHing algorithms, while the mAD AA is a Useful measure to. quantify diversity within the candidate niches. Diversity measures are discussed with respect to the search space, i.e. swarm diversity, and with respect. to solution space,i.e., niche diversity. An empirical study involving the reviewed measures was carried out using a set of multimodal functions optimised using the enhanced species-based particle swarm optimisation (ESPSO) niching algorithm. The obtained diversity results showed that some measures are more suited to the task than others. High niche diversity during the exploration phase indicates that a niched algorithm is capable of identifying potential niches. It is, however, expected that niche diversity will decrease as the swarm moves from the exploration to the exploitation phase. The presented study can thus only be seen as a first step towards this investigation. The analysis of the population diversity of a swarm using a multi-objective search algorithm.

We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as≈7.5×); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized.

These missing portions or gaps are referred to as lacunae. In this study, we employ transformer-based optical character recognition (OCR) models trained on synthetic data containing lacunae in a supervised manner. We demonstrate their effectiveness in detecting and restoring lacunae, achieving a success rate of 65%, compared to a base model lacking knowledge of lacunae, which achieves only 5% restoration. Additionally, we investigate the mechanistic properties of the model, such as the log probability of transcription, which can identify lacunae and other errors (e.g., mistranscriptions due to complex writing or ink issues) in line images without directly inspecting the image. This capability could be valuable for scholars seeking to distinguish images containing lacunae or errors from clean ones. Although we explore the potential of attention mechanisms in flagging lacunae and transcription errors, our findings suggest it is not a significant factor. Our work highlights a promising direction in utilizing transformer-based OCR models for restoring or analyzing damaged historical documents.",1280

We sample text prompts for image generation from three corpora: human-generated image captions, news article sentences, and poem lines. We subject these prompts to different deformances to examine the model's ability to detect changes in imageability caused by compositional change. We find high correlation between the proposed computational measures of imageability and human judgments of individual words.

Building on detailed archival research of the London Library’s lending and book donation records, a digital library of texts borrowed, and publications produced was assembled, which enabled natural language processing approaches to detect textual reuse and similarity, establishing the relationship between Mill and the Library. Text mining the books Mill borrowed and donated against his published outputs demonstrates that the collections of the London Library influenced his thought, transferred into his published oeuvre, and featured in his role as political commentator and public moralist.

We acknowledge, however, that this approach is dependent on the resources and permissions to transcribe extant library registers, and on access to previously digitized sources.

Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data. We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables.

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.",1303

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",1305

This paper considers predicting multiple node labeling functions on graphs simultaneously and revisits this problem from a multitask learning perspective. For a concrete example, consider overlapping community detection: each community membership is a binary node classification task. Due to complex overlapping patterns, we find that negative transfer is prevalent when we apply naive multitask learning to multiple community detection, as task relationships are highly nonlinear across different node labeling. To address the challenge, we develop an algorithm to cluster tasks into groups based on a higher-order task affinity measure. We then fit a multitask model on each task group, resulting in a boosting procedure on top of the baseline model. We estimate the higher-order task affinity measure between two tasks as the prediction loss of one task in the presence of another task and a random subset of other tasks. Then, we use spectral clustering on the affinity score matrix to identify task grouping. We design several speedup techniques to compute the higher-order affinity scores efficiently and show that they can predict negative transfers more accurately than pairwise task affinities. We validate our procedure using various community detection and molecular graph prediction data sets, showing favorable results compared with existing methods.

We investigate generalization properties of fine-tuning to understand the problem of overfitting, which often happens in practice. Previous works have shown that constraining the distance from the initialization of fine-tuning improves generalization. Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation, we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures.

Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on correlations between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor performance on data groups without these correlations. This is challenging to address when the spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To improve worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training attribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach to directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM models can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a trained ERM model’s outputs to identify samples with the same class but dissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive learning to learn similar representations for these samples. To support CNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a representation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe that worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the alignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class’s worst-group vs. average error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss drastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average absolute lift.

When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size of the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and ""memorizing"" the training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling---the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points.

In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: when is combining data from two tasks better than learning one task alone? Intuitively, the transfer effect from one task to another task depends on dataset shifts such as sample sizes and covariance matrices. However, quantifying such a transfer effect is challenging since we need to compare the risks between joint learning and single-task learning, and the comparative advantage of one over the other depends on the exact kind of dataset shift between both tasks. This paper uses random matrix theory to tackle this challenge in a linear regression setting with two tasks. We give precise asymptotics about the excess risks of some commonly used estimators in the high-dimensional regime, when the sample sizes increase proportionally with the feature dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics is provided as a function of the sample sizes and covariate/model shifts, which can be used to study transfer effects: In a random-effects model, we give conditions to determine positive and negative transfers between learning two tasks versus single-task learning; the conditions reveal intricate relations between dataset shifts and transfer effects. Simulations justify the validity of the asymptotics in finite dimensions.

Abstract The ingrained principles of fairness in a dialogue system’s decision-making process and generated responses are crucial for user engagement, satisfaction, and task achievement. Absence of equitable and inclusive principles can hinder the formation of common ground, which in turn negatively impacts the overall performance of the system. For example, misusing pronouns in a user interaction may cause ambiguity about the intended subject. Yet, there is no comprehensive study of equitable text generation in dialogue. Aptly, in this work, we use theories of computational learning to study this problem. We provide formal definitions of equity in text generation, and further, prove formal connections between learning human-likeness and learning equity: algorithms for improving equity ultimately reduce to algorithms for improving human-likeness (on augmented data). With this insight, we also formulate reasonable conditions under which text generation algorithms can learn to generate equitable text without any modifications to the biased training data on which they learn. To exemplify our theory in practice, we look at a group of algorithms for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game and, using this example, test our theory empirically. Our theory accurately predicts relative-performance of multiple algorithms in generating equitable text as measured by both human and automated evaluation.",1324

Our analysis shows that models trained with image–text coherence relations can retrieve images originally paired with target text more often than coherence-agnostic models. We also show via human evaluation that images retrieved by the proposed coherence-aware model are preferred over a coherence-agnostic baseline by a huge margin.

Abstract Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups.",1326

Reasonable settings of learning rate and batch size produce better results than poor settings. Date range is less conclusive. Balancing the date range of the training data to match the benchmark ought to improve performance, but the differences are relatively small. Optimal settings of learning rate and batch size are much better than poor settings, but optimal settings of date range are not that different from poor settings of date range. Finally, we end with concerns about reproducibility. Of the 576 experiments, 10% produced F1 performance above baseline.

Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents).

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political.",1352

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.",1355

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present an adaptation of RNN sequence models to the problem of multi-label classification for text, where the target is a set of labels, not a sequence. Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task.",1373

Automatic real-time text summarization has become an important tool for quickly transforming this overabundance of text into clear, useful information for end-users including affected individuals, crisis responders, and interested third parties. Despite the importance of real-time summarization systems, their evaluation is not well understood as classic methods for text summarization are inappropriate for real-time and streaming conditions. The TREC 2013-2015 Temporal Summarization (TREC-TS) track was one of the first evaluation campaigns to tackle the challenges of real-time summarization evaluation, introducing new metrics, ground-truth generation methodology and dataset. In this paper, we present a study of TREC-TS track evaluation methodology, with the aim of documenting its design, analyzing its effectiveness, as well as identifying improvements and best practices for the evaluation of temporal summarization systems.",1374

For each assessor, we model assessor quality and bias in the form of Gaussian distributed class conditionals of relevance grades. For each document, we model true relevance and difficulty as continuous variables. We estimate all parameters from crowdsourced data, demonstrating better inference of relevance as well as realistic models for both documents and assessors.

We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as≈7.5×); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized.

These missing portions or gaps are referred to as lacunae. In this study, we employ transformer-based optical character recognition (OCR) models trained on synthetic data containing lacunae in a supervised manner. We demonstrate their effectiveness in detecting and restoring lacunae, achieving a success rate of 65%, compared to a base model lacking knowledge of lacunae, which achieves only 5% restoration. Additionally, we investigate the mechanistic properties of the model, such as the log probability of transcription, which can identify lacunae and other errors (e.g., mistranscriptions due to complex writing or ink issues) in line images without directly inspecting the image. This capability could be valuable for scholars seeking to distinguish images containing lacunae or errors from clean ones. Although we explore the potential of attention mechanisms in flagging lacunae and transcription errors, our findings suggest it is not a significant factor. Our work highlights a promising direction in utilizing transformer-based OCR models for restoring or analyzing damaged historical documents.",1384

We sample text prompts for image generation from three corpora: human-generated image captions, news article sentences, and poem lines. We subject these prompts to different deformances to examine the model's ability to detect changes in imageability caused by compositional change. We find high correlation between the proposed computational measures of imageability and human judgments of individual words.

We report here on an international collaboration that explored the interrelation between the reading record and the publications of the British philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill, focusing on his relationship with the London Library, an independent lending library of which Mill was a member for 32 years. Building on detailed archival research of the London Library’s lending and book donation records, a digital library of texts borrowed, and publications produced was assembled, which enabled natural language processing approaches to detect textual reuse and similarity, establishing the relationship between Mill and the Library. Text mining the books Mill borrowed and donated against his published outputs demonstrates that the collections of the London Library influenced his thought, transferred into his published oeuvre, and featured in his role as political commentator and public moralist. We reconceive archival library issue registers as data for triangulating against the growing body of digitized historical texts and the output of leading intellectual figures. We acknowledge, however, that this approach is dependent on the resources and permissions to transcribe extant library registers, and on access to previously digitized sources.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Entity matching is the task of linking records from different sources that refer to the same real-world entity. Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks.As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to “distill” LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle. We perform ablations that highlight the importance of explanations, both for performance and model robustness.",1392

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM.",1393

Abstract Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups.",1394

We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level.",1395

With a novel evaluation framework considering the correctness of QA pairs and their linguistic suitability, our expert evaluation reveals that models struggle to reliably identify information loss and applying similar standards as humans at what constitutes information loss.",1396

More recent efforts have shown that such rationales can also be used for model distillation: Including CoT sequences (elicited from a large ""teacher"" model) in addition to target labels when fine-tuning a small student model yields (often substantial) improvements. In this work we ask: Why and how does this additional training signal help in model distillation? We perform ablations to interrogate this, and report some potentially surprising results. Specifically: (1) Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) realizes consistently better downstream performance -- this means that no student ""reasoning"" is necessary at test time to realize gains. (2) When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements; performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens, for example. In fact, (3) a small number of key tokens are sufficient to achieve improvements equivalent to those observed when full rationales are used in model distillation.",1397

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Many diagnostic errors occur because clinicians cannot easily access relevant information in patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs). In this work we propose a method to use LLMs to identify pieces of evidence in patient EHR data that indicate increased or decreased risk of specific diagnoses; our ultimate aim is to increase access to evidence and reduce diagnostic errors. In particular, we propose a Neural Additive Model to make predictions backed by evidence with individualized risk estimates at time-points where clinicians are still uncertain, aiming to specifically mitigate delays in diagnosis and errors stemming from an incomplete differential. To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual “true” diagnoses. We do so with LLMs, to ensure that the input text is from before a confident diagnosis can be made. We use an LLM to retrieve an initial pool of evidence, but then refine this set of evidence according to correlations learned by the model. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of the usefulness of our approach by simulating how it might be used by a clinician to decide between a pre-defined list of differential diagnoses.",1398

During this process, to provide a test bed for knowledge augmentation, we perform a comprehensive exploration of prompting strategies.

We conduct extensive ablations and analyses to demonstrate that our performance improvements stem from adding relevant definitional knowledge.

However, LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentially misleading) texts by hallucination or omission. In healthcare, this can make LLMs unusable at best and dangerous at worst. We conducted 16 interviews with international systematic review experts to characterize the perceived utility and risks of LLMs in the specific context of medical evidence reviews. Experts indicated that LLMs can assist in the writing process by drafting summaries, generating templates, distilling information, and crosschecking information. They also raised concerns regarding confidently composed but inaccurate LLM outputs and other potential downstream harms, including decreased accountability and proliferation of low-quality reviews. Informed by this qualitative analysis, we identify criteria for rigorous evaluation of biomedical LLMs aligned with domain expert views.",1402

Better automated evaluation metrics are needed, but few resources exist to assess metrics when they are proposed. Therefore, we introduce a dataset of human-assessed summary quality facets and pairwise preferences to encourage and support the development of better automated evaluation methods for literature review MDS. We take advantage of community submissions to the Multi-document Summarization for Literature Review (MSLR) shared task to compile a diverse and representative sample of generated summaries. We analyze how automated summarization evaluation metrics correlate with lexical features of generated summaries, to other automated metrics including several we propose in this work, and to aspects of human-assessed summary quality.

Abstract Pretraining multimodal models on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provides a means of learning representations that can transfer to downstream tasks with minimal supervision. Recent multimodal models induce soft local alignments between image regions and sentences. This is of particular interest in the medical domain, where alignments might highlight regions in an image relevant to specific phenomena described in free-text. While past work has suggested that attention “heatmaps” can be interpreted in this manner, there has been little evaluation of such alignments. We compare alignments from a state-of-the-art multimodal (image and text) model for EHR with human annotations that link image regions to sentences. Our main finding is that the text has an often weak or unintuitive influence on attention; alignments do not consistently reflect basic anatomical information. Moreover, synthetic modifications — such as substituting “left” for “right” — do not substantially influence highlights. Simple techniques such as allowing the model to opt out of attending to the image and few-shot finetuning show promise in terms of their ability to improve alignments with very little or no supervision.

Providing more readable but inaccurate versions of texts may in many cases be worse than providing no such access at all. The problem of factual accuracy (and the lack thereof) has received heightened attention in the context of summarization models, but the factuality of automatically simplified texts has not been investigated. We introduce a taxonomy of errors that we use to analyze both references drawn from standard simplification datasets and state-of-the-art model outputs.

Unfortunately, public resources for developing natural language models for this task are scant.

We find that convention dominates over innovation, as over 96% of the recorded trials focus on previously tested drug targets, and the tested drugs target only 12% of the human interactome. If current patterns persist, it would take 170 years to target all druggable proteins. We uncover two network-based fundamental mechanisms that currently limit target discovery: preferential attachment, leading to the repeated exploration of previously targeted proteins; and local network effects, limiting exploration to proteins interacting with highly explored proteins. We build on these insights to develop a quantitative network-based model of drug discovery. We demonstrate that the model is able to accurately recreate the exploration patterns observed in clinical trials.

We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions. We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules. Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. Our investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width and deeper GCNs are more capable of learning higher order graph moments. Additionally, combining GCN modules with different propagation rules is critical to the representation power of GCNs.",1418

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators.

We prove that the optimization version of this problem is APX-hard but introduce PATHATTACK , a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path.

Recent work has shown that a malicious actor can manipulate a graph to make traffic between two nodes of interest follow their target path. In this paper, we develop a defense against such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose heuristic solutions based on increasing edge weights along target paths in both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum settings. Relaxing some constraints of the original problem, we formulate a linear program for local optimization around a feasible point. We present defense results with both synthetic and real network datasets and show that these methods often reach the lower bound of the defender's cost.",1429

We correlate instability with an increase in edge density, and then theoretically show that in the case of Erdös-Rényi graphs embedded with Laplacian Eigenmaps, the best and worst possible embeddings become less distinguishable as density increases. Furthermore, we present the STABLE algorithm, which takes an existing graph embedding algorithm and makes it stable. We show the effectiveness of STABLE in terms of making the degenerate-core embedding stable and still producing state-of-the-art link prediction performance.",1430

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption.",1433

These approaches fail to capture another potential form of misinformation with a much larger audience: factual news from mainstream sources ('real' news) repurposed to promote false or misleading narratives. We operationalize narratives using an existing unsupervised NLP technique and examine the narratives present in misinformation content. We find that certain articles from reliable outlets are shared by a disproportionate number of users who also shared fake news on Twitter. We consider these 'real' news articles to be co-shared with fake news. We show that co-shared articles contain existing misinformation narratives at a significantly higher rate than articles from the same reliable outlets that are not co-shared with fake news. This holds true even when articles are chosen following strict criteria of reliability for the outlets and after accounting for the alternative explanation of partisan curation of articles. For example, we observe that a recent article published by The Washington Post titled ""Vaccinated people now make up a majority of COVID deaths"" was disproportionately shared by Twitter users with a history of sharing anti-vaccine false news reports. Our findings suggest a strategic repurposing of mainstream news by conveyors of misinformation as a way to enhance the reach and persuasiveness of misleading narratives.

Engagement Outweighs Exposure to Partisan and Unreliable News within Google Search CoRR, abs/2201.00074. https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00074","If popular online platforms systematically expose their users to partisan and unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues like rising political polarization. This concern is central to the echo chamber and filter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information sources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the URLs seen while using an online platform, and engagement, the URLs selected while on that platform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of obtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their regular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data, or estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their centrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have focused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and engagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. We found that participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent relationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed to on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results they chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall engagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed to on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news sources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall. These results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable news on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by users' own choices.",1437

Abstract Stance detection, which aims to determine whether an individual is for or against a target concept, promises to uncover public opinion from large streams of social media data. Yet even human annotation of social media content does not always capture “stance” as measured by public opinion polls. We demonstrate this by directly comparing an individual’s self-reported stance to the stance inferred from their social media data. Leveraging a longitudinal public opinion survey with respondent Twitter handles, we conducted this comparison for 1,129 individuals across four salient targets. We find that recall is high for both “Pro’’ and “Anti’’ stance classifications but precision is variable in a number of cases. We identify three factors leading to the disconnect between text and author stance: temporal inconsistencies, differences in constructs, and measurement errors from both survey respondents and annotators. By presenting a framework for assessing the limitations of stance detection models, this work provides important insight into what stance detection truly measures.",1438

We examined this possibility using longitudinal survey data combined with records of online behavior. Our study found that online misinformation was linked to lower trust in mainstream media across party lines.

This question is especially pertinent with respect to political queries, given growing concerns about filter bubbles, and the recent finding that bias or favoritism in search rankings can influence voting behavior. In this study, we conduct a targeted algorithm audit of Google Search using a dynamic set of political queries. We designed a Chrome extension to survey participants and collect the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and autocomplete suggestions that they would have been exposed to while searching our set of political queries during the month after Donald Trump»s Presidential inauguration.

When Randomness Beats Redundancy: Insights into the Diffusion of Complex Contagions CoRR, abs/2411.07907. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.07907","How does social network structure amplify or stifle behavior diffusion? Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption.",1441

CoRR, abs/2404.14141. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14141","Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed problem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities and evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a tension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the contest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The competitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to their self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their peers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless on 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000 individuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative explanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this tension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly competitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest competitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when high-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not directly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level use of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level outcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term participation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to participate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This suggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future participation. These findings have important implications for the literature on crowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing communities.",1443

In this multi-study research, we quantify ideators' preferences for non-cash incentives and investigate how allowing ideators to self-select their preferred incentive -- offering ideators a choice between cash and non-cash incentives -- affects their creative performance. We further explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest -- social (non-profit) or monetary (for-profit) -- moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness. We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives, such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators' preferences (and the ability to satisfy diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives.

Our results show that the human resemblance of a voice assistant's voice negatively interacts with the helpfulness of an agent's contribution to flip its effect on perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy. This means human teammates interpret the agent's contributions differently depending on its voice. Our study found no significant effect of voice on perceived intelligence, trustworthiness, or team performance. We find differences in these measures are caused by manipulating the helpfulness of an agent.

First, signaling interactions in dynamic networks are sufficient to cause the endogenous formation of distinct signaling groups, even in an initially homogeneous population. Second, dynamic networks allow the emergence of novel {\em hybrid} signaling groups that do not converge on a single common signaling system but are instead composed of different yet complementary signaling strategies. We show that the presence of these hybrid groups promotes stable diversity in signaling among other groups in the population. Third, we find important distinctions in information processing capacity of different groups: hybrid groups diffuse information more quickly initially but at the cost of taking longer to reach all group members.

Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust. Our work highlights the role of emotion awareness and multimodality in generating appropriate grounding moves for conversational agents.",1461

We conducted a between-subjects randomized study comparing a fantasy narrative game to a non-gamified pedagogical virtual agent, with both interventions conveying the same HPV information. Among our study’s 9-12-year-old adolescent participants, our findings demonstrate large pre-to-post improvements in HPV knowledge for both conditions.

However, existing architectural designs that support heterogeneous teams tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Some attempt to encode diverse behaviors within a single shared architecture by appending the input with an ID unique to each robot or robot type. These designs improve sample and parameter efficiency but tend to limit behavioral diversity. Others use a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. We view these two designs as ends of a spectrum and explore a middle-ground approach that enables efficient learning of diverse behaviors. Inspired by work in transfer learning and meta RL, and building upon prior work in trait-based task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a general-purpose soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to enable a single architecture to dynamically adapt to each robot and the current context. Intuitively, CASH encodes shared decision making strategies that can be adapted to each robot based on local observations and the robots' individual and collective capabilities (e.g., speed and payload). CASH explicitly captures the impact of capabilities on collective behavior, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. We conducted experiments across four heterogeneous coordination tasks and three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL) using SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, CASH generates appropriately diverse behaviors and outperforms baseline architectures in task performance and sample efficiency during training and zero-shot generalization while utilizing 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.",1472

Facial expressions are a sensitive, specific biomarker of the presence and severity of pain, and computer vision (CV) and machine-learning (ML) techniques enable reliable, valid measurement of pain-related facial expressions from video. We developed and evaluated a CVML approach to measure pain-related facial expressions for automated pain assessment in youth. Methods: A CVML-based model for assessment of pediatric postoperative pain was developed from videos of 50 neurotypical youth 5 to 18 years old in both endogenous/ongoing and exogenous/transient pain conditions after laparoscopic appendectomy. Model accuracy was assessed for self-reported pain ratings in children and time since surgery, and compared with by-proxy parent and nurse estimates of observed pain in youth. Results: Model detection of pain versus no-pain demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84-0.94) in both ongoing and transient pain conditions. Model detection of pain severity demonstrated moderate-to-strong correlations (r = 0.65-0.86 within; r = 0.47-0.61 across subjects) for both pain conditions. The model performed equivalently to nurses but not as well as parents in detecting pain versus no-pain conditions, but performed equivalently to parents in estimating pain severity. Nurses were more likely than the model to underestimate youth self-reported pain ratings. Demographic factors did not affect model performance. Conclusions: CVML pain assessment models derived from automatic facial expression measurements demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy in binary pain classifications, strong correlations with patient self-reported pain ratings, and parent-equivalent estimation of children's pain levels over typical pain trajectories in youth after appendectomy.",1483

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations.",1486

By estimating the potential information gain of each EMA question using question-answer prediction models, this method can prioritize the presentation of the most informative question in a question-by-question sequence and skip uninformative questions. We evaluated the proposed method by simulating question omission using four real-world datasets from three different EMA studies. When compared against the random question omission approach that skips 50% of the questions, our method reduces imputation errors by 15%-52%. In surveys with five answer options for each question, our method can reduce the mean survey length by 34%-56% with a real-time prediction accuracy of 72%-95% for the skipped questions. The proposed method may either allow more constructs to be surveyed without adding user burden or reduce response burden for more sustainable longitudinal EMA data collection.",1487

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time.

We examined the contextual biases associated with non-response of μEMA prompts on a smartwatch. Based on prior work on EMA non-response and smartwatch use, we identified 10 potential contextual biases from three categories: temporal (time of the day, parts of waking day, day of the week, and days in study), device use (screen state, charging status, battery mode, and phone usage), and activity (wrist motion and location). We used data from a longitudinal study where 131 participants (Mean age 22.9 years, SD = 3.0) responded to μEMA surveys on a smartwatch for at least six months. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, we found that all temporal, activity/mobility, and device use variables had a statistically significant (p<0.001) association with momentary μEMA non-response.

EMA has a key limitation: interruption burden. Microinteraction-EMA(µEMA) may reduce burden without sacrificing high temporal density of measurement. In µEMA, all EMA prompts can be answered with ‘at a glance' microinteractions. In a prior 4-week pilot study comparing standard EMA delivered on a phone (phone-EMA) vs. µEMA delivered on a smartwatch (watch-µEMA), watch-µEMA demonstrated higher response rates and lower perceived burden than phone-EMA, even when the watch-µEMA interruption rate was 8 times more than phone-EMA. A new 4-week dataset was gathered on smartwatch-based EMA (i.e., watch-EMA with 6 back-to-back, multiple-choice questions on a watch) to compare whether the high response rates of watch-µEMA previously observed were a result of using microinteractions, or due to the novelty and accessibility of the smartwatch. No statistically significant differences in compliance, completion, and first-prompt response rates were observed between phone-EMA and watch-EMA. However, watch-µEMA response rates were significantly higher than watch-EMA. This pilot suggests that (1) the high compliance and low burden previously observed in watch-µEMA is likely due to the microinteraction question technique, not simply the use of the watch versus the phone, and that (2) compliance with traditional EMA (with long surveys) may not improve simply by moving survey delivery from the phone to a smartwatch.",1496

To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking.

To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. Toward this, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is slow, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions.

A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions. We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.",1510

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3448116","Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that ""negated"" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such ""negative"" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers.",1511

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3432220","Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-the-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress. There is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions.",1512

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables.

We discovered that due to struggles with self-acceptance and the interdependent relationship between medication, symptoms, schedules, and life changes, the medication management process for students was a highly dynamic journey involving frequent dosage changes. Thus, students adopted flexible strategies of using minimal technology to manage their medication in different situations while maintaining a high degree of autonomy.

We present the design of MATCHA - Medication Action To Check-In for Health Application, informed by exploratory focus groups and design sessions conducted with older adults with MCI and their caregivers, alongside our evaluation based on a two-phased deployment period of 20 weeks. Our results indicate that a conversational “check-in” medication management assistant increased system acceptance while also potentially decreasing the likelihood of accidental over-medication, a common concern for older adults dealing with MCI.",1524

Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication. Sleep disturbances in depression can lead to increased risk of depression and anxiety. Short sleep duration is associated with reduced leptin, elevated ghrelin, and increased body mass index. Sleep efficiency is a metric to measure the quality of a person's sleep, and it can be as important as sleep quantity or quality. We tested the feasibility of predicting poor or good sleep efficiency based on physical activity data from the awake periods from a wearable device (ie, actigraphy) We took a detour from classical methods and proposed deep learning approaches to modeling the relationship between sleep and physical activity. The deidentified data used in this study were collected by Weill Cornell Medical College-Qatar for a research study called Qatar’s Ultimate Education for Sleep in Teenagers. The aim of the study was to determine different sleep patterns in adolescents residing in Qatar and how these related to body weight status. After agreeing to participate in the study, the adolescent participants were provided with an ActiGraph GT3X+ device, placed on their nondominant wrist, and were instructed to wear it at all times for 7 consecutive days and nights. The raw accelerometer data was aggregated into minute-by-minute epochs using a script written in R version 3.3.1. We compared the results of our deep learning models to those of logistic regression. Time-batched LSTM, CNN, and MLP performed the best with AUC scores showing an improvement over LR by 50%, 46%, and 46%, respectively. “Only the simple RNN performed worse than logistic regression in both F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) and accuracy,” the authors wrote in the paper. The deep learning methods of CNN and TB-lSTM were the best performers overall. Their sensitivity (0.97 and 1) showed that these models were able to detect nearly all the cases of “good-quality sleep” The sensitivity (also known as recall), and specificity of each of the models are reported in Table 2. This classification is consequently not an indicator of sleep patterns, but the prediction of a sleep quality parameter that might indicate a potential sleep problem. Deep learning performed better than classical methods in terms of learning useful patterns from raw accelerometer data for the task of sleep quality prediction. Our focus on predicting and forecasting can help design new eHealth applications where predictions are made to personalize coaching for patients or to facilitate decision making of professionals. The expansion of eHealth into sleep is not limited to sleep disorders, but also to improve sleep for people living with chronic conditions such as cancer. To maximize the potential of the wearable mass adoption for sleep health, we need research on not only the reliability of consumer-grade devices but also their data processing and modeling techniques. The study provided an early example of how advanced deep learning methods could be used to infer new insights from raw actigraphY data. It is hoped that this research will lead to a paradigm shift in the study of lifestyle behaviors such as sleep and physical activity.

Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians.

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights.

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models.

Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms).

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.",1557

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",1559

These rules are relied upon by compilers, libraries, and foreign-function interfaces. Unfortunately, ABIs are typically specified in prose, and while type systems for source languages have evolved, ABIs have comparatively stalled, lacking advancements in expressivity and safety. We propose a vision for richer, semantic ABIs to improve interoperability and library integration, supported by a methodology for formally specifying ABIs using realizability models. These semantic ABIs connect abstract, high-level types to unwieldy, but well-behaved, low-level code. We illustrate our approach with a case study formalizing the ABI of a functional source language in terms of a reference-counting implementation in a C-like target language. A key contribution supporting this case study is a graph-based model of separation logic that captures the ownership and accessibility of reference-counted resources using modalities inspired by hybrid logic. To highlight the flexibility of our methodology, we show how various design decisions can be interpreted into the semantic ABI. Finally, we provide the first formalization of library evolution, a distinguishing feature of Swift’s ABI.",1560

We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-setlike models of probability.",1561

Lang., 8, 864-892. https://doi.org/10.1145/3649842","In gradual typing, different languages perform different dynamic type checks for the same program even though the languages have the same static type system. This raises the question of whether, given a gradually typed language, the combination of the translation that injects checks in well-typed terms and the dynamic semantics that determines their behavior sufficiently enforce the static type system of the language. Neither type soundness, nor complete monitoring, nor any other meta-theoretic property of gradually typed languages to date provides a satisfying answer. In response, we present vigilance, a semantic analytical instrument that defines when the check-injecting translation and dynamic semantics of a gradually typed language are adequate for its static type system. Technically, vigilance asks if a given translation-and-semantics combination enforces the complete run-time typing history of a value, which consists of all of the types associated with the value. We show that the standard combination for so-called Natural gradual typing is vigilant for the standard simple type system, but the standard combination for Transient gradual typing is not. At the same time, the standard combination for Transient is vigilant for a tag type system but the standard combination for Natural is not. Hence, we clarify the comparative type-level reasoning power between the two most studied approaches to sound gradual typing. Furthermore, as an exercise that demonstrates how vigilance can guide design, we introduce and examine a new theoretical static gradual type system, dubbed truer, that is stronger than tag typing and more faithfully reflects the type-level reasoning power that the dynamic semantics of Transient gradual typing can guarantee.",1562

Semantic Encapsulation using Linking Types TyDe@ICFP, 14-28. https://doi.org/10.1145/3609027.3609405","Interoperability pervades nearly all mainstream language implementations, as most systems leverage subcomponents written in different languages. And yet, such linking can expose a language to foreign behaviors that are internally inexpressible, which poses a serious threat to safety invariants and programmer reasoning. To preserve such invariants, a language may try to add features to limit the reliance on external libraries, but endless extensions can obscure the core abstractions the language was designed to provide. In this paper, we outline an approach that encapsulates foreign code in a sound way—i.e., without disturbing the invariants promised by types of the core language. First, one introduces novel linking types that characterize the behaviors of foreign libraries that are inexpressible in the core language. To reason about the soundness of linking, one constructs a realizability model that captures the meaning of both core types and linking types as sets of target-language terms. Using this model, one can formally prove when foreign behavior is encapsulated ; that is, unobservable to core code. We show one way to discharge such proofs automatically by augmenting the compiler to insert verified encapsulation wrappers around components that use foreign libraries. Inspired by existing approaches to FFIs, we develop a pair of case studies that extend a pure, functional language: one extension for state, and another for exceptions. The first allows us to implement mutable references via a library, whereas the second allows us to implement try and catch as library functions. Both extensions and the overall system are proven sound using logical relations that use realizability techniques.",1564

This combining operation forms the basis for our model of separation, and produces a logic with many pleasant properties. In particular, Lilac has a frame rule identical to the ordinary one, and naturally accommodates advanced features like continuous random variables and reasoning about quantitative properties of programs.

Type-preserving compilation can be used to preserve these specifications and proofs of correctness through compilation into the generated target-language programs. Unfortunately, type-preserving compilation of dependent types is hard. In essence, the problem is that dependent type systems are designed around high-level compositional abstractions to decide type checking, but compilation interferes with the type-system rules for reasoning about run-time terms. We develop a type-preserving closure-conversion translation from the Calculus of Constructions (CC) with strong dependent pairs (Σ types)—a subset of the core language of Coq—to a type-safe, dependently typed compiler intermediate language named CC-CC. The central challenge in this work is how to translate the source type-system rules for reasoning about functions into target type-system rules for reasoning about closures. To justify these rules, we prove soundness of CC-CC by giving a model in CC. In addition to type preservation, we prove correctness of separate compilation.",1568

An Empirical Examination of Fuzzer Mutator Performance ISSTA, 1631-1642. https://doi.org/10.1145/3650212.3680387","Over the past decade, hundreds of fuzzers have been published in top-tier security and software engineering conferences. Fuzzers are used to automatically test programs, ideally creating high-coverage input corpora and finding bugs. Modern “greybox” fuzzers evolve a corpus of inputs by applying mutations to inputs and then executing those new inputs while collecting coverage. New inputs that are “interesting” (e.g. reveal new coverage) are saved to the corpus. Given their non-deterministic nature, the impact of each design decision on the fuzzer’s performance can be difficult to predict. Some design decisions (e.g., ” Should the fuzzer perform deterministic mutations of inputs? ”) are exposed to end-users as configuration flags, but others (e.g., ” What kinds of random mutations to apply to inputs?”) are typically baked into the fuzzer code itself. This paper describes our over 12.5-CPU-year evaluation of the set of mutation operators employed by the popular AFL++ fuzzer, including the havoc phase, splicing, and, exploring the impact of adjusting some of those unexposed configurations. In this experience paper, we propose a methodology for determining different fuzzers’ behavioral diversity with respect to branch coverage and bug detection using rigorous statistical methods. Our key finding is that, across a range of targets, disabling certain mutation operators (some of which were previously “baked-in” to the fuzzer) resulted in inputs that cover different lines of code and reveal different bugs. A surprising result is disabling certain mutators leads to more diverse coverage and allows the fuzzer to find more bugs faster . We call for researchers to investigate seemingly simple design decisions in fuzzers more thoroughly and encourage fuzzer developers to expose more configuration parameters pertaining to these design decisions to end users.",1569

Parametric fuzzers internally represent inputs as bit strings referred to as ""parameter sequences"". Interesting parameter sequences are saved by the fuzzer and perturbed to create new inputs without the need for type-specific operators. However, existing work on parametric fuzzing only uses mutation operators, which modify a single input; it does not incorporate crossover, an evolutionary operator that blends multiple inputs together. Crossover operators aim to combine advantageous traits from multiple inputs. However, the nature of parametric fuzzing limits the effectiveness of traditional crossover operators. In this paper, we propose linked crossover, an approach for using dynamic execution information to identify and exchange analogous portions of parameter sequences. We created an implementation of linked crossover for Java and evaluated linked crossover's ability to preserve advantageous traits. We also evaluated linked crossover's impact on fuzzer performance on seven real-world Java projects and found that linked crossover consistently performed as well as or better than three state-of-the-art parametric fuzzers and two other forms of crossover on both long and short fuzzing campaigns.",1570

Most fuzzers operate by generating inputs for applications and mutating the bytes of those inputs, guiding the fuzzing process with branch coverage feedback via instrumentation. Whitebox guidance (e.g., taint tracking or concolic execution) is sometimes integrated with coverage-guided fuzzing to help cover tricky-to-reach branches that are guarded by complex conditions (so-called ""magic values""). This integration typically takes the form of a targeted input mutation, e.g. , placing particular byte values at a specific offset of some input in order to cover a branch. However, these dynamic analysis techniques are not perfect in practice, which can result in the loss of important relationships between input bytes and branch predicates, thus reducing the effective power of the technique. We introduce a new, surprisingly simple, but effective technique, global hinting , which allows the fuzzer to insert these interesting bytes not only at a targeted position, but in any position of any input. We implemented this idea in Java, creating Confetti, which uses both targeted and global hints for fuzzing. In an empirical comparison with two baseline approaches, a state-of-the-art greybox Java fuzzer and a version of Confetti without global hinting, we found that Confetti covers more branches and finds 15 previously unreported bugs, including 9 that neither baseline could find. By conducting a post-mortem analysis of Confetti's execution, we determined that global hinting was at least as effective at revealing new coverage as traditional, targeted hinting.",1573

Orthogonal to this dimension, Natural systems ensure the integrity of types with a sophisticated contract system, while Transient systems insert simple first-order checks at strategic places within typed code. Furthermore, each method of ensuring type integrity comes with its own blame-assignment strategy.Typed Racket has a rich migratory type system and enforces the types with a Natural semantics. Reticulated Python has a simple structural type system extended with Dynamic and enforces types with a Transient semantics. While Typed Racket satisfies the most stringent gradual-type soundness properties at a significant performance cost, Reticulated Python seems to limit the performance penalty to a tolerable degree and is nevertheless type sound.

This transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in the original imperative programs. We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture.

However, this type migration process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper examines the problem of automated type migration: given a dynamic program, infer additional or improved type annotations. Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities. We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the migration to be compatible with unmigrated code. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ""challenge problems."" Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties of gradual type migration.

We argue that these problems could be addressed if WebAssembly natively supported first-class continuations. We then present Wasm/k, which extends WebAssembly with delimited continuations. Wasm/k introduces no new value types, and thus does not require significant changes to the WebAssembly type system (validation). Wasm/k is safe, even in the presence of foreign function calls (e.g., to and from JavaScript). Finally, Wasm/k is amenable to efficient implementation: we implement Wasm/k as a local change to Wasmtime, an existing WebAssembly JIT. We evaluate Wasm/k by implementing C/k, which adds delimited continuations to C/C++. C/k uses Emscripten and its implementation serves as a case study on how to use Wasm/k in a compiler that targets WebAssembly. We present several case studies using C/k, and show that on implementing green threads, it can outperform the state-of-the-art approach Asyncify with an 18% improvement in performance and a 30% improvement in code size.",1589

Such a paradigm, while very effective, suffers from a few key problems: 1) NNs are opaque to the user and hence not amenable to verification, 2) they require significant amounts of training data, and 3) they are hard to repair when the domain changes. We present two key insights about ASPs for robotics. First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we introduce layered dimension-informed program synthesis (LDIPS) - by reasoning about the physical dimensions of state variables, and dimensional constraints on operators, LDIPS directly synthesizes ASPs in a human-interpretable domain-specific language that is amenable to program repair. We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots.",1591

Formal Foundations of Serverless Computing. ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA), 2019. Distinguished Paper Award","Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λ Λ , an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λ Λ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λ Λ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λ Λ coincide. Second, we augment λ Λ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λ Λ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work. The latest version of this paper, corrects an error in Definition 4.2 and thus the proof of Theorem 4.3, which were found in the published version. PDF available on arXiv",1593

We present interactive SMT-based Robot Transition Repair* (SRTR): instead of manually adjusting parameters, we ask the roboticist to identify a few instances where the robot is in a wrong state and what the right state should be. An automated analysis of the transition function 1) identifies adjustable parameters, 2) converts the transition function into a system of logical constraints, and 3) formulates the constraints and user-supplied corrections as a MaxSMT problem that yields new parameter values. We show that finds new parameters 1) quickly, 2) with few corrections, and 3) that the parameters generalize to new scenarios.

Rehearsal: A Configuration Verification Tool for Puppet. ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), 2016","Large-scale data centers and cloud computing have turned system configuration into a challenging problem. Several widely-publicized outages have been blamed not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is that configurations can be non-deterministic. This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations. Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver. Rehearsal then leverages the determinacy analysis to check other important properties, such as idempotency. Finally, we apply Rehearsal to several real-world Puppet configurations.

We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-setlike models of probability.",1596

In this paper, we outline how we can encode design constraints into a compact circuit representation that affords generation without search. These generators yield samples that are distributed uniformly over the space of valid designs.

Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these approaches are not using.

This combining operation forms the basis for our model of separation, and produces a logic with many pleasant properties. In particular, Lilac has a frame rule identical to the ordinary one, and naturally accommodates advanced features like continuous random variables and reasoning about quantitative properties of programs.

Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis, network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis, but they prove to be challenging for existing PPLs. We develop a domain-specific probabilistic programming language called Dice that features a new approach to exact discrete probabilistic program inference. Dice exploits program structure in order to factorize inference, enabling us to perform exact inference on probabilistic programs with hundreds of thousands of random variables. Our key technical contribution is a new reduction from discrete probabilistic programs to weighted model counting (WMC). This reduction separates the structure of the distribution from its parameters, enabling logical reasoning tools to exploit that structure for probabilistic inference. We (1) show how to compositionally reduce Dice inference to WMC, (2) prove this compilation correct with respect to a denotational semantics, (3) empirically demonstrate the performance benefits over prior approaches, and (4) analyze the types of structure that allow Dice to scale to large probabilistic programs.",1603

And yet, such linking can expose a language to foreign behaviors that are internally inexpressible, which poses a serious threat to safety invariants and programmer reasoning. To preserve such invariants, a language may try to add features to limit the reliance on external libraries, but endless extensions can obscure the core abstractions the language was designed to provide. In this paper, we outline an approach that encapsulates foreign code in a sound way—i.e., without disturbing the invariants promised by types of the core language. First, one introduces novel linking types that characterize the behaviors of foreign libraries that are inexpressible in the core language. To reason about the soundness of linking, one constructs a realizability model that captures the meaning of both core types and linking types as sets of target-language terms. Using this model, one can formally prove when foreign behavior is encapsulated ; that is, unobservable to core code. We show one way to discharge such proofs automatically by augmenting the compiler to insert verified encapsulation wrappers around components that use foreign libraries. Inspired by existing approaches to FFIs, we develop a pair of case studies that extend a pure, functional language: one extension for state, and another for exceptions. The first allows us to implement mutable references via a library, whereas the second allows us to implement try and catch as library functions.

Analyzing binding extent in 3CPS Proc. ACM Program. Lang., 6, 650-678. https://doi.org/10.1145/3547645","To date, the most effective approach to compiling strict, higher-order functional languages (such as OCaml, Scheme, and SML) has been to use whole-program techniques to convert the program to a first-order monomorphic representation that can be optimized using traditional compilation techniques. This approach, popularized by MLton, has limitations, however. We are interested in exploring a different approach to compiling such languages, one that preserves the higher-order and polymorphic character of the program throughout optimization. To enable such an approach, we must have effective analyses that both provide precise information about higher-order programs and that scale to larger units of compilation. This paper describes one such analysis for determining the extent of variable bindings. We classify the extent of variables as either register (only one binding instance can be live at any time), stack (the lifetimes of binding instances obey a LIFO order), or heap (binding lifetimes are arbitrary). These extents naturally connect variables to the machine resources required to represent them. We believe that precise information about binding extents will enable efficient management of environments, which is a key problem in the efficient compilation of higher-order programs. At the core of the paper is the 3CPS intermediate representation, which is a factored CPS-based intermediate representation (IR) that statically marks variables to indicate their binding extent. We formally specify the management of this binding structure by means of a small-step operational semantics and define a static analysis that determines the extents of the variables in a program. We evaluate our analysis using a standard suite of SML benchmark programs. Our implementation gets surprisingly high yield and exhibits scalable performance. While this paper uses a CPS-based IR, the algorithm and results are easily transferable to other λ-calculus IRs, such as ANF.",1613

Code coverage has been the most popular metric to assess test suite quality. However, traditional code coverage criteria do not adequately reflect completion, interactions, and error handling of asynchronous operations. This paper proposes novel test adequacy criteria for measuring: (i) completion of asynchronous operations in terms of both successful and exceptional execution, (ii) registration of reactions for handling both possible outcomes, and (iii) execution of said reactions through tests. We implement JScope, a tool for automatically measuring coverage according to these criteria in JavaScript applications, as an interactive plug-in for Visual Studio Code. An evaluation of JScope on 20 JavaScript applications shows that the proposed criteria can help improve assessment of test adequacy, complementing traditional criteria. According to our investigation of 15 real GitHub issues concerned with asynchrony, the new criteria can help reveal faulty asynchronous behaviors that are untested yet are deemed covered by traditional coverage criteria. We also report on a controlled experiment with 12 participants to investigate the usefulness of JScope in realistic settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving programmers’ ability to assess test adequacy and detect untested behavior of asynchronous code.",1614

Unfortunately, migrating existing projects to take advantage of this feature is nontrivial, as the code changes required to introduce asynchrony may involve complex, non-local transformations.

Call graphs are at the core of many interprocedural static analysis and optimization techniques. However, WebAssembly poses some unique challenges for static call graph construction. Currently, these challenges are neither well understood, nor is it clear to what extent existing techniques address them. This paper presents the first systematic study of WebAssembly-specific challenges for static call graph construction and of the state-of-the-art in call graph analysis. We identify and classify 12 challenges, encode them into a suite of 24 executable microbenchmarks, and measure their prevalence in real-world binaries. These challenges reflect idiosyncrasies of WebAssembly, such as indirect calls via a mutable function table, interactions with the host environment, and unmanaged linear memory. We show that they commonly occur across a set of more than 8,000 real-world binaries. Based on our microbenchmarks and a set of executable real-world binaries, we then study the soundness and precision of four existing static analyses. Our findings include that, surprisingly, all of the existing techniques are unsound, without this being documented anywhere. We envision our work to provide guidance for improving static call graph construction for WebAssembly. In particular, the presented microbenchmarks will enable future work to check whether an analysis supports challenging language features, and to quantify its soundness and precision.",1616

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques.

Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones.

State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition.

Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action.

Fuzzers are used to automatically test programs, ideally creating high-coverage input corpora and finding bugs. Modern “greybox” fuzzers evolve a corpus of inputs by applying mutations to inputs and then executing those new inputs while collecting coverage. New inputs that are “interesting” (e.g. reveal new coverage) are saved to the corpus. Given their non-deterministic nature, the impact of each design decision on the fuzzer’s performance can be difficult to predict. Some design decisions (e.g., ” Should the fuzzer perform deterministic mutations of inputs? ”) are exposed to end-users as configuration flags, but others (e.g., ” What kinds of random mutations to apply to inputs?”) are typically baked into the fuzzer code itself. This paper describes our over 12.5-CPU-year evaluation of the set of mutation operators employed by the popular AFL++ fuzzer, including the havoc phase, splicing, and, exploring the impact of adjusting some of those unexposed configurations. In this experience paper, we propose a methodology for determining different fuzzers’ behavioral diversity with respect to branch coverage and bug detection using rigorous statistical methods. Our key finding is that, across a range of targets, disabling certain mutation operators (some of which were previously “baked-in” to the fuzzer) resulted in inputs that cover different lines of code and reveal different bugs. A surprising result is disabling certain mutators leads to more diverse coverage and allows the fuzzer to find more bugs faster .

However, existing work on parametric fuzzing only uses mutation operators, which modify a single input; it does not incorporate crossover, an evolutionary operator that blends multiple inputs together. Crossover operators aim to combine advantageous traits from multiple inputs. However, the nature of parametric fuzzing limits the effectiveness of traditional crossover operators. In this paper, we propose linked crossover, an approach for using dynamic execution information to identify and exchange analogous portions of parameter sequences.

Recognizing the potential parallels between human-powered Q&A platforms and AI-powered question-based chatbots, we investigate and compare how developers integrate this assistance into their real-world coding experiences by conducting a thematic analysis of 1700+ Reddit posts. Through a comparative study of SO and ChatGPT, we identified each platform's strengths, use cases, and barriers. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT offers fast, clear, comprehensive responses and fosters a more respectful environment than SO. However, concerns about ChatGPT's reliability stem from its overly confident tone and the absence of validation mechanisms like SO's voting system.

Together with the data collected in the research process, they are collectively referred to as research artifacts and are subject to artifact evaluation (AE) at scientific conferences. Since its initiation in the SE community at ESEC/FSE 2011, both the goals and the process of AE have evolved and today expectations towards AE are strongly linked with reproducible research results and reusable tools that other researchers can build their work on. However, to date little evidence has been provided that artifacts which have passed AE actually live up to these high expectations, i.e., to which degree AE processes contribute to AE's goals and whether the overhead they impose is justified. We aim to fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of research artifacts from a decade of software engineering (SE) and programming languages (PL) conferences, based on which we reflect on the goals and mechanisms of AE in our community. In summary, our analyses (1) suggest that articles with artifacts do not generally have better visibility in the community, (2) provide evidence how evaluated and not evaluated artifacts differ with respect to different quality criteria, and (3) highlight opportunities for further improving AE processes.",1665

Most fuzzers operate by generating inputs for applications and mutating the bytes of those inputs, guiding the fuzzing process with branch coverage feedback via instrumentation. Whitebox guidance (e.g., taint tracking or concolic execution) is sometimes integrated with coverage-guided fuzzing to help cover tricky-to-reach branches that are guarded by complex conditions (so-called ""magic values""). This integration typically takes the form of a targeted input mutation, e.g. , placing particular byte values at a specific offset of some input in order to cover a branch. However, these dynamic analysis techniques are not perfect in practice, which can result in the loss of important relationships between input bytes and branch predicates, thus reducing the effective power of the technique. We introduce a new, surprisingly simple, but effective technique, global hinting , which allows the fuzzer to insert these interesting bytes not only at a targeted position, but in any position of any input. We implemented this idea in Java, creating Confetti, which uses both targeted and global hints for fuzzing. In an empirical comparison with two baseline approaches, a state-of-the-art greybox Java fuzzer and a version of Confetti without global hinting, we found that Confetti covers more branches and finds 15 previously unreported bugs, including 9 that neither baseline could find. By conducting a post-mortem analysis of Confetti's execution, we determined that global hinting was at least as effective at revealing new coverage as traditional, targeted hinting.",1666

DOI: 10.1145/3485488","Gradually typed languages allow programmers to mix statically and dynamically typed code, enabling them to incrementally reap the benefits of static typing as they add type annotations to their code. However, this type migration process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper examines the problem of automated type migration: given a dynamic program, infer additional or improved type annotations. Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities. We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the migration to be compatible with unmigrated code. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ""challenge problems."" Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties of gradual type migration. In addition, we apply TypeWhich to a suite of benchmarks for Grift, a programming language based on the GTLC.

The performance of high-level languages depends not only on the underlying performance of WebAssembly, but also on the quality of the generated WebAssembly code.

We argue that these problems could be addressed if WebAssembly natively supported first-class continuations. We then present Wasm/k, which extends WebAssembly with delimited continuations. Wasm/k introduces no new value types, and thus does not require significant changes to the WebAssembly type system (validation). Wasm/k is safe, even in the presence of foreign function calls (e.g., to and from JavaScript). Finally, Wasm/k is amenable to efficient implementation: we implement Wasm/k as a local change to Wasmtime, an existing WebAssembly JIT. We evaluate Wasm/k by implementing C/k, which adds delimited continuations to C/C++. C/k uses Emscripten and its implementation serves as a case study on how to use Wasm/k in a compiler that targets WebAssembly.

First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies.

We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots.",1681

Formal Foundations of Serverless Computing. ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA), 2019. Distinguished Paper Award","Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λ Λ , an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λ Λ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λ Λ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λ Λ coincide. Second, we augment λ Λ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λ Λ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work. The latest version of this paper, corrects an error in Definition 4.2 and thus the proof of Theorem 4.3, which were found in the published version. PDF available on arXiv",1683

Since transitions depend on physical parameters, when the environment changes, a roboticist has to painstakingly readjust the parameters to work in the new environment. We present interactive SMT-based Robot Transition Repair* (SRTR): instead of manually adjusting parameters, we ask the roboticist to identify a few instances where the robot is in a wrong state and what the right state should be. An automated analysis of the transition function 1) identifies adjustable parameters, 2) converts the transition function into a system of logical constraints, and 3) formulates the constraints and user-supplied corrections as a MaxSMT problem that yields new parameter values. We show that finds new parameters 1) quickly, 2) with few corrections, and 3) that the parameters generalize to new scenarios.

Rehearsal: A Configuration Verification Tool for Puppet. ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), 2016","Large-scale data centers and cloud computing have turned system configuration into a challenging problem. Several widely-publicized outages have been blamed not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is that configurations can be non-deterministic. This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations. Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver. Rehearsal then leverages the determinacy analysis to check other important properties, such as idempotency. Finally, we apply Rehearsal to several real-world Puppet configurations.

The neural MCTS algorithm has been successful in finding near-optimal strategies for games through self-play. However, the AlphaZero algorithm has a significant drawback; it takes a long time to converge and requires high computational power due to complex neural networks for solving games like Chess, Go, Shogi, etc. Owing to this, it is very difficult to pursue neural MCTS research without cutting-edge hardware, which is a roadblock for many aspiring neural MCTS researchers. In this paper, we propose a new neural MCTS algorithm, called Dual MCTS, which helps overcome these drawbacks. Dual MCTS uses two different search trees, a single deep neural network, and a new update technique for the search trees using a combination of the PUCB, a sliding-window, and the epsilon-greedy algorithm. This technique is applicable to any MCTS based algorithm to reduce the number of updates to the tree. We show that Dual MCTS performs better than one of the most widely used neural MCTS algorithms, AlphaZero, for various symmetric and asymmetric games.",1688

Knowing that every QSAT problem is equivalent to a QSAT game, the game outcome can be used to derive the solutions of the original QSAT problems. We propose a way to encode Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs) as graphs and apply a graph neural network (GNN) to embed the QBFs into the neural MCTS. After training, an off-the-shelf QSAT solver is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

Therefore, learning to play a semantic game perfectly leads to the solution of a specific instance of a combinatorial problem.

It reflects our belief that the core task of an optimising compiler for a functional language is to reason about the environment structure of the program.

This approach, popularized by MLton, has limitations, however. We are interested in exploring a different approach to compiling such languages, one that preserves the higher-order and polymorphic character of the program throughout optimization. To enable such an approach, we must have effective analyses that both provide precise information about higher-order programs and that scale to larger units of compilation. This paper describes one such analysis for determining the extent of variable bindings. We classify the extent of variables as either register (only one binding instance can be live at any time), stack (the lifetimes of binding instances obey a LIFO order), or heap (binding lifetimes are arbitrary). These extents naturally connect variables to the machine resources required to represent them. We believe that precise information about binding extents will enable efficient management of environments, which is a key problem in the efficient compilation of higher-order programs. At the core of the paper is the 3CPS intermediate representation, which is a factored CPS-based intermediate representation (IR) that statically marks variables to indicate their binding extent. We formally specify the management of this binding structure by means of a small-step operational semantics and define a static analysis that determines the extents of the variables in a program. We evaluate our analysis using a standard suite of SML benchmark programs. Our implementation gets surprisingly high yield and exhibits scalable performance.

Code coverage has been the most popular metric to assess test suite quality.

This paper proposes novel test adequacy criteria for measuring: (i) completion of asynchronous operations in terms of both successful and exceptional execution, (ii) registration of reactions for handling both possible outcomes, and (iii) execution of said reactions through tests. We implement JScope, a tool for automatically measuring coverage according to these criteria in JavaScript applications, as an interactive plug-in for Visual Studio Code. An evaluation of JScope on 20 JavaScript applications shows that the proposed criteria can help improve assessment of test adequacy, complementing traditional criteria. According to our investigation of 15 real GitHub issues concerned with asynchrony, the new criteria can help reveal faulty asynchronous behaviors that are untested yet are deemed covered by traditional coverage criteria. We also report on a controlled experiment with 12 participants to investigate the usefulness of JScope in realistic settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving programmers’ ability to assess test adequacy and detect untested behavior of asynchronous code.",1694

Unfortunately, migrating existing projects to take advantage of this feature is nontrivial, as the code changes required to introduce asynchrony may involve complex, non-local transformations.

Call graphs are at the core of many interprocedural static analysis and optimization techniques. However, WebAssembly poses some unique challenges for static call graph construction. Currently, these challenges are neither well understood, nor is it clear to what extent existing techniques address them. This paper presents the first systematic study of WebAssembly-specific challenges for static call graph construction and of the state-of-the-art in call graph analysis. We identify and classify 12 challenges, encode them into a suite of 24 executable microbenchmarks, and measure their prevalence in real-world binaries. These challenges reflect idiosyncrasies of WebAssembly, such as indirect calls via a mutable function table, interactions with the host environment, and unmanaged linear memory. We show that they commonly occur across a set of more than 8,000 real-world binaries. Based on our microbenchmarks and a set of executable real-world binaries, we then study the soundness and precision of four existing static analyses. Our findings include that, surprisingly, all of the existing techniques are unsound, without this being documented anywhere. We envision our work to provide guidance for improving static call graph construction for WebAssembly. In particular, the presented microbenchmarks will enable future work to check whether an analysis supports challenging language features, and to quantify its soundness and precision.",1696

Fuzzing is an approach for automatically exercising code, and could be used to obtain more runnable code.

When it comes to maintaining and evolving these systems, the lack of explicit static typing becomes a bottleneck. In response, researchers have explored the idea of gradually-typed programming languages which allow the incremental addition of type annotations to software written in one of these untyped languages. Some of these new, hybrid languages insert run-time checks at the boundary between typed and untyped code to establish type soundness for the overall system. With sound gradual typing, programmers can rely on the language implementation to provide meaningful error messages when type invariants are violated. While most research on sound gradual typing remains theoretical, the few emerging implementations suffer from performance overheads due to these checks. None of the publications on this topic comes with a comprehensive performance evaluation. Worse, a few report disastrous numbers. In response, this paper proposes a method for evaluating the performance of gradually-typed programming languages. The method hinges on exploring the space of partial conversions from untyped to typed. For each benchmark, the performance of the different versions is reported in a synthetic metric that associates runtime overhead to conversion effort. The paper reports on the results of applying the method to Typed Racket, a mature implementation of sound gradual typing, using a suite of real-world programs of various sizes and complexities. Based on these results the paper concludes that, given the current state of implementation technologies, sound gradual typing faces significant challenges. Conversely, it raises the question of how implementations could reduce the overheads associated with soundness and how tools could be used to steer programmers clear from pathological cases.",1704

To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights.

The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis.",1708

Effective clinical decision-making, including the detection of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and the monitoring of associated symptoms, remains a challenging task for clinicians. This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making.",1709

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.",1710

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making.",1712

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of IPv6 usage in smart homes in a testbed equipped with 93 distinct, popular consumer IoT devices. We investigate whether and how they support and use IPv6, focusing on factors such as IPv6 addressing, configuration, DNS and destinations, and privacy and security practices. We find that, despite most devices having some degree of IPv6 support, in an IPv6-only network just 20.4% transmit data to Internet IPv6 destinations, and only 8.6% remain functional, indicating that consumer IoT devices are not yet ready for IPv6 networks. Furthermore, 16.1% of devices use easily traceable IPv6 addresses, posing privacy risks. Our findings highlight the inadequate IPv6 support in consumer IoT devices compared to conventional devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This gap is concerning, as it may lead to not only usability issues but also privacy and security risks for smart home users.",1713

Our results show that Amazon and third parties, including advertising and tracking services that are unique to the smart speaker ecosystem, collect smart speaker interaction data. We also find that Amazon processes smart speaker interaction data to infer user interests and uses those inferences to serve targeted ads to users. Smart speaker interaction also leads to ad targeting and as much as 30X higher bids in ad auctions, from third party advertisers.

While there has been some work on identifying devices and a handful of activities, an open question is what is the extent to which we can automatically model the entire behavior of an IoT deployment, and how it changes over time, without any privileged access to IoT devices or platform messages. In this work, we demonstrate that the vast majority of IoT behavior can indeed be modeled, using a novel multi-dimensional approach that relies only on the (often encrypted) network traffic exchanged by IoT devices. Our key insight is that IoT behavior (including cross-device interactions) can often be captured using relatively simple models such as timers (for periodic behavior) and probabilistic state-machines (for user-initiated behavior and devices interactions) during a limited observation phase. We then propose deviation metrics that can identify when the behavior of an IoT device or an IoT system changes over time.

To this end, we gather more than two years of TLS network traffic from IoT devices, conduct active probing to test for vulnerabilities, and develop a novel blackbox technique for exploring the trusted root stores in IoT devices by exploiting a side-channel through TLS Alert Messages. We find a wide range of behaviors across devices, with some adopting best security practices but most being vulnerable in one or more of the following ways: use of old/insecure protocol versions and/or ciphersuites, lack of certificate validation, and poor maintenance of root stores. Specifically, we find that at least 8 IoT devices still include distrusted certificates in their root stores, 11/32 devices are vulnerable to TLS interception attacks, and that many devices fail to adopt modern protocol features over time.

Checkpointing is an important component in any strategy for software resilience and for long-running jobs that must be executed by chaining together time-bounded resource allocations. This work solves an old problem: a practical and general algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI that is both efficient and compatible with most of the latest network software. Transparent checkpointing is attractive due to its generality and ease of use for most MPI application developers. Earlier efforts at transparent checkpointing for MPI, one decade ago, had two difficult problems: (i) by relying on a specific MPI implementation tied to a specific network technology; and (ii) by failing to demonstrate sufficiently low runtime overhead.Problem (i) (network dependence) was already solved in 2019 by MANA's introduction of split processes. Problem (ii) (efficient runtime overhead) is solved in this work. This paper introduces an approach that avoids these limitations, employing a novel topological sort to algorithmically determine a safe future synchronization point. The algorithm is valid for both blocking and non-blocking collective communication in MPI. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach through both micro-benchmarks and a set of five real-world MPI applications, notably including the widely used VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package), which is responsible for 11% of the workload on the Perlmutter supercomputer at Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory.

The problem is made more difficult when supporting collective operations across processes, such as barrier, reduce operations, scatter and gather, etc. Some processes may have reached the barrier or other collective operation, while other processes wait a long time to reach that same barrier or collective operation. At least two solutions are well-known in the literature: (I) draining in-flight network messages and then freezing the network at checkpoint time; and (ii) adding a barrier prior to the collective operation, and either completing the operation or aborting the barrier if not all processes are present. Both solutions suffer important drawbacks. The code in the first solution must be updated whenever one ports to a newer network. The second solution implies additional barrier-related network traffic prior to each collective operation. This work presents a third solution that avoids both drawbacks. There is no additional barrier-related traffic, and the solution is implemented entirely above the network layer. The work is demonstrated in the context of transparent checkpointing of MPI libraries for parallel computation, where each of the first two solutions have already been used in prior systems, and then abandoned due to the aforementioned drawbacks.

While the totality of SG data represents a tremendous contribution to genomics and structural biology, reliable functional information for these proteins is generally lacking. Better functional predictions for SG proteins will add substantial value to the structural information already obtained. Our method described herein, Graph Representation of Active Sites for Prediction of Function (GRASP-Func), predicts quickly and accurately the biochemical function of proteins by representing residues at the predicted local active site as graphs rather than in Cartesian coordinates. We compare the GRASP-Func method to our previously reported method, Structurally Aligned Local Sites of Activity (SALSA), using the Ribulose Phosphate Binding Barrel (RPBB), 6-Hairpin Glycosidase (6-HG), and Concanavalin A-like Lectins/Glucanase (CAL/G) superfamilies as test cases. In each of the superfamilies, SALSA and the much faster method GRASP-Func yield similar correct classification of previously characterized proteins, providing a validated benchmark for the new method. In addition, we analyzed SG proteins using our SALSA and GRASP-Func methods to predict function. Forty-one SG proteins in the RPBB superfamily, nine SG proteins in the 6-HG superfamily, and one SG protein in the CAL/G superfamily were successfully classified into one of the functional families in their respective superfamily by both methods. This improved, faster, validated computational method can yield more reliable predictions of function that can be used for a wide variety of applications by the community.

Was this another case of an idea quickly fading from future to past tense, relegating work in this area to the graveyard of failed technologies? The recently introduced Compute Express Link (CXL) may offer a path forward, with its persistent memory profile offering a universal PMem attachment point. Yet new technologies for memory-speed persistence seem years off, and may never become competitive with evolving DRAM and flash speeds. Without persistent memory itself, is future PMem research doomed? We offer two arguments for why reports of the death of PMem research are greatly exaggerated. First, the bulk of persistent-memory research has not in fact addressed memory persistence, but rather in-memory crash consistency, which was never an issue in prior systems where CPUs could not observe post-crash memory states. CXL memory pooling allows multiple hosts to share a single memory, all in different failure domains, raising crash-consistency issues even with volatile memory. Second, we believe CXL necessitates a ""disaggregation"" of PMem research. Most work to date assumed a single technology and set of features, i.e. , speed, byte addressability, and CPU load/store access. With an open interface allowing new topologies and diverse PMem technologies, we argue for the need to examine these features individually and in combination. While one form of PMem may have been canceled, we argue that the research problems it raised not only remain relevant but have expanded in a CXL-based future.",1728

Both cache and backend store are order-preserving, enabling LSVD to provide strong consistency guarantees in case of failure.

Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values.",1732

One well-known instance of these attacks is the widespread use of trick banners that use social engineering techniques to lure victims into clicking on deceptive fake links, potentially leading to a malicious domain or malware. A recent and pervasive trend by attackers is to imitate the ""download"" or ""play"" buttons in popular file sharing sites (e.g., one-click hosters, video-streaming sites, bittorrent sites) in an attempt to trick users into clicking on these fake banners instead of the genuine link. In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically assisting Internet users in detecting malicious trick banners and helping them identify the correct link. We present a set of features to characterize trick banners based on their visual properties such as image size, color, placement on the enclosing webpage, whether they contain animation effects, and whether they consistently appear with the same visual properties on consecutive loads of the same webpage. We have implemented a tool called TrueClick, which uses image processing and machine learning techniques to build a classifier based on these features to automatically detect the trick banners on a webpage. Our approach automatically classifies trick banners, and requires no manual effort to compile blacklists as current approaches do. Our experiments show that TrueClick results in a 3.55 factor improvement in correct link selection in the absence of other ad blocking software, and that it can detect trick banners missed by a popular ad detection tool, Adblock Plus.",1733

Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Hammurabi into Firefox and the Go language in less than 100 lines of code each.",1735

Over the years, informal conventions or ""norms"" for transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based on their offered ""transaction fee-per-byte."" Bitcoin users are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels.

In turn, large-scale content providers are forced to use staggering numbers of addresses, ultimately leading to address exhaustion (IPv4) and inefficiency (IPv6). In this paper, we revisit IP bindings, entirely. We attempt to evolve addressing conventions by decoupling IP in DNS and from network sockets. Alongside technologies such as SNI and ECMP, a new architecture emerges that ``unbinds'' IP from services and servers, thereby returning IP's role to merely that of reachability. The architecture is under evaluation at a major CDN in multiple datacenters. We show that addresses can be generated randomly \emph{per-query}, for 20M+ domains and services, from as few as ~4K addresses, 256 addresses, and even \emph{one} IP address. We explain why this approach is transparent to routing, L4/L7 load-balancers, distributed caching, and all surrounding systems -- and is \emph{highly desirable}. Our experience suggests that many network-oriented systems and services (e.g., route leak mitigation, denial of service, measurement) could be improved, and new ones designed, if built with addressing agility.",1738

In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first system and mobile app for identifying traffic differentiation for arbitrary applications in the mobile environment (i.e., wireless networks such as cellular and WiFi, used by smartphones and tablets).

We perform the first known testbed experiments with actual commercial shaping devices to validate our system design and demonstrate how it outperforms previous work for detecting differentiation. We released our app and collected differentiation results from 12 ISPs in 5 countries.

We discovered that current IBN specifications and implementations do not specify that flow rule installation orderings should be enforced, which leads to temporal vulnerabilities where, for a limited time, attackers can exploit indeterminate connectivity behavior to gain unauthorized network access. In this paper, we analyze the causes of such temporal vulnerabilities and their security impacts with a representative case study via the ONOS IBN implementation. We devise the Phantom Link attack and demonstrate a working exploit to highlight the security impacts. To defend against such attacks, we propose Spotlight, a detection method that can alert a system administrator of risky intent updates prone to exploitable temporal vulnerabilities.

Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks.",1745

We propose a theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models. We also introduce a fast statistical attack that requires limited knowledge of the training process. Finally, we design a new principled defense method that is highly resilient against all poisoning attacks.

Our key insight is that securely computing the (threshold) Hamming distance between two inputs can be reduced to securely computing their inner product. Leveraging this reduction, we construct a Fuzzy PSI protocol using recent techniques for inner-product predicate encryption. To enable the use of predicate encryption in our setting, we establish that these predicate encryption schemes satisfy a weak notion of simulation security and demonstrate how their internal key derivation can be efficiently distributed without a trusted third party.

This paradigm will be the foundation of future cellular core networks beyond 5G. The new architecture splits network functionalities into smaller logical entities that can be disaggregated logically, physically, and geographically. This affords interoperability between the mobile network operators and commercial software and hardware vendors or cloud providers. By making use of commodity services and products, this system construct inherits the vulnerabilities in those underlying technologies, thereby increasing its attack surface and requiring a rigorous security analysis.

These applications are typically used to provide departure clearance, en-route services such as altitude and flight plan changes, air traffic surveillance and reporting, and radio frequency assignments. Unlike most attacks proposed so far where the attacker influences decision-making through manipulated instruments, attacks on aviation datalink provide adversaries with a new attack vector to influence the flight crew’s decision-making through direct instructions. In this work, we perform a security analysis of these applications and outline the requirements for executing a successful attack. Specifically, we propose a coordinated multi-aircraft attack and show how an adversary capable of spoofing datalink messages and reactive jamming can influence the flight crew’s decision-making. Through geospatial analysis of historical flight data, we identify 48 vulnerable regions where an attacker has a 90% chance of encountering favorable conditions for coordinated multi-aircraft attacks. Next, we implement a reactive jammer that ensures stealthy attack execution by targeting messages from a specific aircraft with a reaction time of 1.48 ms and 98.85% jamming success.

Our approach and system DEFORM, a Deep Learning (DL) based RX beamforming achieves significant gain for multi antenna RF receivers while being agnostic to the transmitted signal features (e.g., modulation or bandwidth). It is well known that combining coherent RF signals from multiple antennas results in a beamforming gain proportional to the number of receiving elements. However in practice, this approach heavily relies on explicit channel estimation techniques, which are link specific and require significant communication overhead to be transmitted to the receiver. DEFORM addresses this challenge by leveraging Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the channel characteristics in particular the relative phase to antenna elements. It is specifically designed to address the unique features of wireless signals complex samples, such as the ambiguous2πphase discontinuity and the high sensitivity of the link Bit Error Rate. The channel prediction is subsequently used in the Maximum Ratio Combining algorithm to achieve an optimal combination of the received signals. While being trained on a fixed, basic RF settings, we show that DEFORM DL model is universal, achieving up to 3 dB of SNR gain for a two antenna receiver in extensive experiments demonstrating various settings of modulations, bandwidths, and channels. The universality of DEFORM is demonstrated through joint beamforming relaying of LoRa (Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation) and ZigBee signals, achieving significant improvements to Packet Loss/Delivery Rates relatively to conventional Amplify and Forward (LoRa PLR reduced by 23 times and ZigBee PDR increased by 8 times).",1755

In this paper, we are concerned with the design and evaluation of a universal anti-jamming building block, that is agnostic to the specifics of the communication link and can therefore be combined with existing technologies. We believe that such a block should not require explicit probes, sounding, training sequences, channel estimation, or even the cooperation of the transmitter. To meet these requirements, we propose an approach that relies on advances in Machine Learning, and the promises of neural accelerators and software defined radios. We identify and address multiple challenges, resulting in a convolutional neural network architecture and models for a multi-antenna system to infer the existence of interference, the number of interfering emissions and their respective phases. This information is continuously fed into an algorithm that cancels the interfering signal. We develop a two-antenna prototype system and evaluate our jamming cancellation approach in various environment settings and modulation schemes using Software Defined Radio platforms. We demonstrate that the receiving node equipped with our approach can detect a jammer with over 99% of accuracy and achieve a Bit Error Rate (BER) as low as10−6even when the jammer power is nearly two orders of magnitude (18 dB) higher than the legitimate signal, and without requiring modifications to the link modulation.

In this work, we explore more robust constructions for hidden volumes and present HiVE, which is resistant to more powerful adversaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. In pursuit of this, we propose the first security definitions for hidden volumes, and prove HiVE secure under these definitions. At the core of HiVE, we design a new write-only Oblivious RAM. We show that, when only hiding writes, it is possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O(1) communication complexity and only poly-logarithmic user memory.

However, they are challenging to implement correctly because they have to deal with any unexpected message from byzantine peers and ensure safety and liveness at all times. Many formal frameworks have been developed to verify the safety of SMR implementations, but there is still a gap in the verification of their liveness. Existing liveness proofs are either limited to the network level or do not cover popular partially synchronous protocols. We introduce LiDO, a consensus model that enables the verification of both safety and liveness of implementations through refinement. We observe that current consensus models cannot handle liveness because they do not include a pacemaker state. We show that by adding a pacemaker state to the LiDO model, we can express the liveness properties of SMR protocols as a few safety properties that can be easily verified by refinement proofs. Based on our LiDO model, we provide mechanized safety and liveness proofs for both unpipelined and pipelined Jolteon in Coq.

We build on recent work on the atomic distributed object model to fill this void with a novel abstraction called AdoB. In addition to revealing important insights into the essence of consensus, this abstraction has practical benefits for easing distributed system verification. As a case study, we proved safety and liveness properties for AdoB in Coq, which are the first such mechanized proofs to handle benign and byzantine consensus in a unified manner.

As evidence we observe that nearly all of them avoid the complex, but important issue of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration's primary challenge lies in how it interacts with a protocol's core safety invariants. To handle this increased complexity, we introduce the Adore model, whose novel abstract state hides network-level communications while capturing dependencies between committed and uncommitted states, as well as metadata like election quorums. It includes first-class support for a generic reconfiguration command that can be instantiated with a variety of implementations.

Unfortunately, existing approaches either completely hide these failures behind an atomic state machine replication (SMR) interface, or expose all of the network-level details, sacrificing atomicity. We propose a novel, compositional, atomic distributed object (ADO) model for strongly consistent distributed systems that combines the best of both options. The object-oriented API abstracts over protocol-specific details and decouples high-level correctness reasoning from implementation choices. At the same time, it intentionally exposes an abstract view of certain key distributed failure cases, thus allowing for more fine-grained control over them than SMR-like models. We demonstrate that proving properties even of composite distributed systems can be straightforward with our Coq verification framework, Advert, thanks to the ADO model. We also show that a variety of common protocols including multi-Paxos and Chain Replication refine the ADO semantics, which allows one to freely choose among them for an application's implementation without modifying ADO-level correctness proofs.",1766

For example, a server may spread terabytes of data across many different storage media, ranging from magnetic disks, DRAM, NAND-based solid state drives (SSDs), as well as hybrid drives that package various combinations of these technologies. It follows that access latencies to data can vary hugely depending on which media the data resides on. At the same time, modern storage systems naturally retain older versions of data due to the prevalence of log-structured designs and caches in software and hardware layers. In a sense, a contemporary storage system is very similar to a small-scale distributed system, opening the door to consistency/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose a class of local storage systems called StaleStores that support relaxed consistency, returning stale data for better performance. We describe several examples of StaleStores, and show via emulations that serving stale data can improve access latency by between 35% and 20X. We describe a particular StaleStore called Yogurt, a weakly consistent local block storage system. Depending on the application's consistency requirements (e.g. bounded staleness, mono-tonic reads, read-my-writes, etc.), Yogurt queries the access costs for different versions of data within tolerable staleness bounds and returns the fastest version. We show that a distributed key-value store running on top of Yogurt obtains a 6X speed-up for access latency by trading off consistency and performance within individual storage servers.",1767

As a result, new high-level storage abstractions—and new designs for existing abstractions—are difficult to realize, requiring developers to implement from scratch complex functionality such as failure atomicity and fine-grained concurrency control. In this paper, we argue that pushing transactional isolation into the block store (in addition to atomicity and durability) is both viable and broadly useful, resulting in simpler high-level storage systems that provide strong semantics without sacrificing performance. We present Isotope, a new block store that supports ACID transactions over block reads and writes. Internally, Isotope uses a new multi-version concurrency control protocol that exploits fine-grained, sub-block parallelism in workloads and offers both strict serializability and snapshot isolation guarantees. We implemented several high-level storage systems over Isotope, including two key-value stores that implement the LevelDB API over a hashtable and B-tree, respectively, and a POSIX filesystem. We show that Isotope’s block-level transactions enable systems that are simple (100s of lines of code), robust (i.e., providing ACID guarantees), and fast (e.g., 415 MB/s for random file writes).

We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size.",1770

Bugs in these compilers can result in models whose semantics differ from the original ones, producing incorrect results that corrupt the correctness of downstream applications. However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs. We implemented this approach in NNSmith which has found 72 new bugs for TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch to date.

Yet, this swift growth brings with it substantial challenges, notably the surge in scam tokens, imposing significant security threats on cryptocurrency investments and trading. Existing detection methods of scam token, primarily relying on analyzing contract codes or transaction patterns, struggle to catch increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by scammers. For example, contract-based analysis are unable to identify scams lacking overt malicious code, e.g., most rugpulls, while transaction-based methods generally lack the foresight to early-detect potential risks. In this paper, we present TokenScout, the first temporal temporal graph neural network-based framework for scam token early detection. TokenScout formulates token transfer data as a dynamic temporal attributed multigraph and leverages the temporal graph learning model to learn graph representations. It also builds a graph representation refining model based on contrastive learning to learn a more discriminative representation space for risk identification. We evaluated TokenScout using a comprehensive dataset of 214,084 standard ERC20 tokens from 2015 to February 2023. TokenScout achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.41%.

One approach to prevent such attacks is to enforce control-flow integrity (CFI), but inlined CFI enforcement can pose challenges in embedded systems. For example, it increases binary size and changes memory layout. Trace-based control-flow violation detection (CFVD) offers an alternative that doesn't require instrumentation of the protected software or changes to its memory layout. However, existing CFVD methods used in desktop systems require kernel modifications to store and analyze the trace, which limits their use to monitoring unprivileged applications. But, embedded systems are interrupt-driven, with the majority of processing taking place in the privileged mode. Therefore, it is critical to provide a holistic and system-oriented CFVD solution that can monitor control-flow transfers both within and among privileged and unprivileged components. In this paper, we present SHERLOC, a Secure and Holistic Control-Flow Violation Detection mechanism designed for microcontroller-based embedded systems. SHERLOC ensures security by configuring the hardware tracing unit, storing trace records, and executing the violation detection algorithm in a trusted execution environment, which prevents privileged programs from bypassing monitoring or tampering with the trace. We address the challenges of achieving holistic and system-oriented CFVD by formalizing the problem and monitoring forward and backward edges of unprivileged and privileged programs, as well as control-flow transfers among unprivileged and privileged components. Specifically, SHERLOC overcomes the challenges of identifying legitimate asynchronous interrupts and context switches at run-time by using an interrupt- and scheduling-aware violation detection algorithm. Our evaluations on the ARMv8-M architecture demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SHERLOC.",1784

Whereas previous automated audio description (AD) systems provide single-tool approaches for delivering minimum viable description (MVD) or delivering on-demand visual question answering (VQA), we present a tandem AI-based AD tool that combines MVD and on-demand VQA. A user study with 26 BLV individuals explored how the tandem system may be used under the conditions of delivering MVD and/or on-demand VQA with AI-only or human-in-the-loop support. When each tool was used in isolation, AI-only conditions scored significantly lower in both user enjoyment and comprehension. When used in tandem, AI-only conditions matched outcomes delivered with human-in-the-loop, which suggests that AI-only AD tools may be most effective when both types of tools are used in tandem. A multimodal analysis of interactions with the tandem system revealed areas for system improvement in terms of the timing of AD delivery and accurate content delivery.

Understanding device behavior is important not only for determining whether devices are functioning as expected, but also can reveal implications for privacy (e.g., surreptitious audio/video recording), security (e.g., device compromise), and safety (e.g., denial of service on a baby monitor). While there has been some work on identifying devices and a handful of activities, an open question is what is the extent to which we can automatically model the entire behavior of an IoT deployment, and how it changes over time, without any privileged access to IoT devices or platform messages. In this work, we demonstrate that the vast majority of IoT behavior can indeed be modeled, using a novel multi-dimensional approach that relies only on the (often encrypted) network traffic exchanged by IoT devices. Our key insight is that IoT behavior (including cross-device interactions) can often be captured using relatively simple models such as timers (for periodic behavior) and probabilistic state-machines (for user-initiated behavior and devices interactions) during a limited observation phase. We then propose deviation metrics that can identify when the behavior of an IoT device or an IoT system changes over time.

We provide implications for platforms, such as using marginalized users’ folk theories as tools to identify elements of platform moderation systems that function incorrectly and disproportionately impact marginalized users.",1792

To program these architectures using ordinary languages such as C, a dataflow compiler must transform the original sequential, imperative program into an equivalent dataflow graph, composed of dataflow operators running in parallel. This transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in the original imperative programs. We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture. Our tool uncovers 8 compiler bugs where the compiler outputs incorrect dataflow graphs, including a data race that is otherwise hard to discover via testing. After repairing these bugs, our tool verifies the correct compilation of all programs in the RipTide benchmark suite.",1793

Current mechanization efforts tend to either focus on diff-equivalence, which establishes observational equivalence between protocols with identical control structures, or require an explicit witness for the observational equivalence in the form of a bisimulation relation. Our goal is to simplify proofs for cryptographic protocols by introducing a core calculus, IPDL, for cryptographic observational equivalences. Via IPDL, we aim to address a number of theoretical issues for cryptographic proofs in a simple manner, including probabilistic behaviors, distributed message-passing, and resource-bounded adversaries and simulators. We demonstrate IPDL on a number of case studies, including a distributed coin toss protocol, Oblivious Transfer, and the GMW multi-party computation protocol.

DOI: 10.1145/3548606.3560594","This paper proposes using a logic programming language to disentangle X.509 certificate validation policy from mechanism. Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Hammurabi into Firefox and the Go language in less than 100 lines of code each.",1796

Yet SQL can be hard to read, even for expert users or the original creator of a query. We conjecture that it is possible to capture the logical intent of queries in automatically-generated visual diagrams that can help users understand the meaning of queries faster and more accurately than SQL text alone. We present initial steps in that direction with visual diagrams that are based on the first-order logic foundation of SQL and can capture the meaning of deeply nested queries. Our diagrams build upon a rich history of diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic and were designed using a large body of human-computer interaction best practices: they are minimal in that no visual element is superfluous; they are unambiguous in that no two queries with different semantics map to the same visualization; and they extend previously existing visual representations of relational schemata and conjunctive queries in a natural way. An experimental evaluation involving 42 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that with only a 2--3 minute static tutorial, participants could interpret queries meaningfully faster with our diagrams than when reading SQL alone. Moreover, we have evidence that our visual diagrams result in participants making fewer errors than with SQL. We believe that more regular exposure to diagrammatic representations of SQL can give rise to a pattern-based and thus more intuitive use and re-use of SQL.

For full conjunctive queries, including cyclic ones, our approach is optimal in terms of the time to return the top result and the delay between results. These optimality properties are derived for the widely used notion of data complexity, which treats query size as a constant. By performing a careful cost analysis, we are able to uncover a previously unknown tradeoff between two incomparable enumeration approaches: one has lower complexity when the number of returned results is small, the other when the number is very large. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the superiority of our techniques over batch algorithms, which produce the full result and then sort it.

Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deep-seated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI.

A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions. We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.",1806

Our evaluations of 4 popular IoT camera development platforms and 12 commercial off-the-shelf devices with cameras show that EM Eye poses threats to a wide range of devices, from smartphones to dash cams and home security cameras. By exploiting this vulnerability, adversaries may be able to visually spy on private activities in an enclosed room from the other side of a wall. We provide root cause analysis and modeling that enable system defenders to identify and simulate mitigation against this vulnerability, such as improving embedded cameras' data transmission protocols with minimum costs.

This paper performs a security analysis of the keyboard sensing mechanisms and uncovers a new class of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to induce phantom keys---fake keystrokes injected into keyboards' analog circuits in a contactless way using electromagnetic interference (EMI). Besides normal keystrokes, such phantom keys also include keystrokes that cannot be achieved by human operators, such as rapidly injecting over 10,000 keys per minute and injecting hidden keys that do not exist on the physical keyboard. The underlying principles of phantom key injection consist in inducing false voltages on keyboard sensing GPIO pins through EMI coupled onto matrix circuits. We investigate the voltage and timing requirements of injection signals both theoretically and empirically to establish the theory of phantom key injection. To validate the threat of keyboard sensing vulnerabilities, we design GhostType that can cause denial-of-service of the keyboard and inject random keystrokes as well as certain targeted keystrokes of the adversary's choice. We have validated GhostType on 48 of 50 off-the-shelf keyboards/keypads from 20 brands including both membrane/mechanical structures and USB/Bluetooth protocols.

However, the dynamic allocation of IP addresses can be abused by adversaries to source malicious traffic, bypass rate limiting systems, and even capture traffic intended for other cloud tenants. As a result, both the cloud provider and their customers are put at risk, and defending against these threats requires a rigorous analysis of tenant behavior, adversarial strategies, and cloud provider policies. In this paper, we develop a practical defense for IP address allocation through such an analysis. We first develop a statistical model of cloud tenant deployment behavior based on literature and measurement of deployed systems. Through this, we analyze IP allocation policies under existing and novel threat models. In response to our stronger proposed threat model, we design IP scan segmentation, an IP allocation policy that protects the address pool against adversarial scanning even when an adversary is not limited by number of cloud tenants.

We characterize EM Eye--a vulnerability in the digital image data transmission interface that allows adversaries to reconstruct high-quality image streams from the cameras' unintentional electromagnetic emissions, even from over 2 meters away in many cases. Our evaluations of 4 popular IoT camera development platforms and 12 commercial off-the-shelf devices with cameras show that EM Eye poses threats to a wide range of devices, from smartphones to dash cams and home security cameras. By exploiting this vulnerability, adversaries may be able to visually spy on private activities in an enclosed room from the other side of a wall. We provide root cause analysis and modeling that enable system defenders to identify and simulate mitigation against this vulnerability, such as improving embedded cameras' data transmission protocols with minimum costs.

This paper performs a security analysis of the keyboard sensing mechanisms and uncovers a new class of vulnerabilities that can be exploited to induce phantom keys---fake keystrokes injected into keyboards' analog circuits in a contactless way using electromagnetic interference (EMI). Besides normal keystrokes, such phantom keys also include keystrokes that cannot be achieved by human operators, such as rapidly injecting over 10,000 keys per minute and injecting hidden keys that do not exist on the physical keyboard. The underlying principles of phantom key injection consist in inducing false voltages on keyboard sensing GPIO pins through EMI coupled onto matrix circuits. We investigate the voltage and timing requirements of injection signals both theoretically and empirically to establish the theory of phantom key injection. To validate the threat of keyboard sensing vulnerabilities, we design GhostType that can cause denial-of-service of the keyboard and inject random keystrokes as well as certain targeted keystrokes of the adversary's choice. We have validated GhostType on 48 of 50 off-the-shelf keyboards/keypads from 20 brands including both membrane/mechanical structures and USB/Bluetooth protocols. Some example consequences of GhostType include completely blocking keyboard operations, crashing and turning off downstream computers, and deleting files on computers.

We first develop a statistical model of cloud tenant deployment behavior based on literature and measurement of deployed systems. Through this, we analyze IP allocation policies under existing and novel threat models.

Advances in MRI have revolutionized the diagnosis of FCD, resulting in higher success rates for resective epilepsy surgery. However, many patients with histologically confirmed FCD have normal presurgical MRI studies (‘MRI-negative’), making presurgical diagnosis difficult. The purpose of this study was to test whether a novel MRI postprocessing method successfully detects histopathologically verified FCD in a sample of patients without visually appreciable lesions. We applied an automated quantitative morphometry approach which computed five surface-based MRI features and combined them in a machine learning model to classify lesional and nonlesional vertices. Accuracy was defined by classifying contiguous vertices as “lesional” when they fell within the surgical resection region. Our multivariate method correctly detected the lesion in 6 of 7 MRI-positive patients, which is comparable with the detection rates that have been reported in univariate vertex-based morphometry studies. More significantly, in patients that were MRI-negative, machine learning correctly identified 14 out of 24 FCD lesions (58%). This was achieved after separating abnormal thickness and thinness into distinct classifiers, as well as separating sulcal and gyral regions. Results demonstrate that MRI-negative images contain sufficient information to aid in the in vivo detection of visually elusive FCD lesions.",1823

Korupolu ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures, July 2016","Motivated by the growing complexity and heterogeneity of modern data centers, and the prevalence of commodity com- ponent failures, this paper studies the failure-aware place- ment problem of placing tasks of a parallel job on machines in the data center with the goal of increasing availability. We consider two models of failures: adversarial and prob- abilistic. In the adversarial model, each node has a weight (higher weight implying higher reliability) and the adver- sary can remove any subset of nodes of total weight at most a given bound W and our goal is to ﬁnd a placement that incurs the least disruption against such an adversary. In the probabilistic model, each node has a probability of failure and we need to ﬁnd a placement that maximizes the proba- bility that at least K out of N tasks survive at any time. For adversarial failures, we ﬁrst show that (i) the prob- lems are in Σ2, the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, (ii) a basic variant, that we call RobustFAP, is co-NP- hard, and (iii) an all-or-nothing version of RobustFAP is Σ2-complete. We then give a PTAS for RobustFAP, a key ingredient of which is a solution that we design for a frac- tional version of RobustFAP. We then study fractional Ro- bustFAP over hierarchies, denoted HierRobustFAP, and introduce a notion of hierarchical max-min fairness and a novel Generalized Spreading algorithm which is simultane- ously optimal for all W. These generalize the classical notion of max-min fairness to work with nodes of diﬀering capaci- ties, diﬀering reliability weights and hierarchical structures. Using randomized rounding, we extend this to give an algo- rithm for integral HierRobustFAP. For the probabilistic version, we ﬁrst give an algorithm that achieves an additive ε approximation in the failure probability for the single level version, called ProbFAP, while giving up a (1+ε) multiplicative factor in the number of failures. We then extend the result to the hierarchical ver- sion, HierProbFAP, achieving an ε additive approximation ∗Supported in part by NSF grants CNS-1217981, CCF- 1422715, and CCF-1535929, and a Google Research Award.

For both classes, we give hardness results and approximation algorithms for multiple variants: based on generalized spreading for HierRobust- FAP and Poisson approximation for HierProbFAP. One natural question is to improve the approximation guarantees and design more practical implementations for some of the variants. In particular, the approximation fac- tor in the bicriteria PTAS for HierProbFAP grows linearly in the number of levels. While this is reasonable for current datacenters (which typically have three to four levels of hi- erarchy), it would be interesting to see if the approximation factor can be made sublinear or even independent of number of levels. Similarly, our PTASes incur high running times (e.g., for RobustFAP, a standard implementation would take time O(n(3+ln(1/ε))/ε) time), and it is important to de- sign practical implementations of PTASes that trade oﬀap- proximation guarantees for simplicity. On a related note, our study here has focused on identical tasks of the same size. It will be interesting to extend this to an on-line sequence of jobs of possibly diﬀerent sizes.

Improving Deep Policy Gradients with Value Function Search ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6qZC7pfenQm","Deep Policy Gradient (PG) algorithms employ value networks to drive the learn- ing of parameterized policies and reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. However, value function approximation gets stuck in local optima and struggles to fit the actual return, limiting the variance reduction efficacy and leading policies to sub-optimal performance. This paper focuses on improving value approxima- tion and analyzing the effects on Deep PG primitives such as value prediction, variance reduction, and correlation of gradient estimates with the true gradient. To this end, we introduce a Value Function Search that employs a population of perturbed value networks to search for a better approximation. Our framework does not require additional environment interactions, gradient computations, or ensembles, providing a computationally inexpensive approach to enhance the su- pervised learning task on which value networks train. Crucially, we show that improving Deep PG primitives results in improved sample efficiency and policies with higher returns using common continuous control benchmark domains. 1VFS introduces a two-scale perturbation operator voted to diversify a population of value networks to (i) explore local variations of current critics’ predictions and (ii) allow to explore diversified value functions to escape from local optima. The practical results of such components have been investigated with additional experiments that also motivate the improvement in sample efficiency and performance of VFS-based algorithms in a range of standard continuous control benchmarks. Our findings suggest that improving fundamental Deep PG primitives translates into higher-performing policies and better sample efficiency. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 7",1825

How.

The practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is limited to only small-scale synchronous decision-making scenarios or a single agent planning its best response against a single adversary with ﬁxed, procedurally characterized strategies. In contrast this paper considers a more realistic class of problems where a team of asynchronous agents with limited observation and communication capabilities need to compete against multiple strategic adversaries with changing strategies. This problem necessitates agents that can coordinate to detect changes in adversary strategies and plan the best response accordingly. Our approach ﬁrst optimizes a set of stratagems that represent these best responses. These optimized stratagems are then inte- grated into a uniﬁed policy that can detect and respond when the adversaries change their strategies. The near-optimality of the proposed framework is established theoretically as well as demonstrated empirically in simulation and hardware.This paper introduces a novel near-optimal adversarial pol- icy switching algorithm for decentralized, non-cooperative multi-agent systems. Unlike the existing works in literature which are mostly limited to simple decision-making sce- narios where a single agent plans its best response against an adversary whose strategy is speciﬁed a priori under reasonable assumptions, we investigate instead a class of multi-agent scenarios where multiple robots need to operate independently in collaboration with their teammates to act effectively against adversaries with changing strategies. To achieve this, we ﬁrst optimize a set of basic stratagems that each is tuned to respond optimally to a pre-identiﬁed basic tactic of the adversaries. The stratagems are then integrated into a uniﬁed policy which performs near-optimally against B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 (a) (b) (c) B3 B2 B1 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 (d) (e) (f) Fig. 6: Image excerpts from a video demo showing (1) a team of 3 allied (blue) robots (B1,B2 and B3) that implement the optimized stratagem produced by our framework (Section III) to compete against (2) an opposing team of 2 opponent (red) robots (R1 and R2) which implement the hand-coded tactics DL and DR (see Section VI-A), respectively: (a) B1,B2 and B3 decide to invade the opposition territory; (b) B1 and B3 decide to attack the center while B2 decides to take the left ﬂank of the opposition; (c) B2 passes through R1’s defense while B1 takes an interesting position to block R2 so that B3 can pass through its defense; (d) B1 and B2 detect the ﬂag and mount a pincer attack; (e) R2 arrives to defend the ﬂag and B2 retreats to avoid getting tagged; and (f) without noticing B1 from behind, R2 continues its DR patrol, thus losing the ﬂag to B1. any high-level strategies of the adversaries that switches between their basic tactics. The near-optimality of our pro- posed framework can be established in both theoretical and empirical settings with interesting and consistent results.

We apply our algorithm to a novel tagging problem and an extended version of a common benchmark, where it generates poli- cies that meet or exceed the values of equivalent discretized domains without the need for ﬁnding an adequate discretization. 1This paper presented, for the ﬁrst time, an algorithm that gen- erates joint policies for Dec-POMDPs with continuous ob- servations. We presented both a discrete-observation ver- sion of the algorithm, which is applicable in domains with a large number of discrete observations, and a continuous- observation version. This method is broadly applicable as many real-world domains have large or continuous observa- tion spaces. COG-DICE has been successful in generating joint policies for both a novel and a preexisting problem and has highlighted the negative impacts that inappropriate dis- cretization can have on joint policy structure and value. For future work, we are interested in extending this work to high- dimensional observation spaces by exploring other (nonlin- ear) divisions and optimizing the algorithm parameters by ei- ther integrating these optimizations into the algorithm or pos- sibly building on previous work on Bayesian non-parametrics [Liu et al., 2015].",1827

Emergent World Representations: Exploring a Sequence Model Trained on a Synthetic Task ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DeG07_TcZvT","Language models show a surprising range of capabilities, but the source of their apparent competence is unclear. Do these networks just memorize a collection of surface statistics, or do they rely on internal representations of the process that generates the sequences they see? We investigate this question in a synthetic setting by applying a variant of the GPT model to the task of predicting legal moves in a simple board game, Othello. Although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules, we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state. Interventional experiments indicate this representation can be used to control the output of the network. By leveraging these intervention techniques, we produce “latent saliency maps” that help explain predictions. 1 1Our experiments provide evidence that Othello-GPT maintains a representation of game board states— that is, the Othello “world”—to produce sequences it was trained on. This representation appears to be nonlinear in an essential way. Further, we find that these representations can be causally linked to how the model makes its predictions. Understanding of the internal representations of a sequence model is interesting in its own right, but may also be helpful in deeper interpretations of the network. We have also described how interventional experiments may be used to create a “latent saliency map”, which gives a picture, in terms of the Othello board, of how the network has made a prediction. Applied to two versions of Othello-GPT that were trained on different data sets, the latent saliency maps highlight the dramatic differences between underlying representations of the Othello-GPT trained on synthetic dataset and its counterpart trained on championship dataset. There are several potential lines of future work. One natural extension would be to perform the same type of investigations with other, more complex games. It would also be interesting to compare the strategies learned by a sequence model trained on game transcripts with those of a model trained with a priori knowledge of Othello. One option is to compare latent saliency maps of Othello–GPT with standard saliency maps of an Othello-playing program which has the actual board state as input. More broadly, it would be interesting to study how our results generalize to models trained on natural language. One stepping stone might be to look at language models whose training data has included game transcripts. Will we see similar representation of board state? Grammar engineering tools (Weston et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2017; Cˆot´e et al., 2018) could help define a synthetic data generation process that maps world representations onto natural language sentences, providing a similarly controllable setting like Othello while closing the distance to natural languages. For more complex natural language tasks, can we find meaningful world representations? Our hope is that the tools described in this paper—nonlinear probes, layerwise interventions, and latent saliency maps—may prove useful in natural language settings. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023",1828

Given the NP-hardness of the utility function, we consider its convex relaxation based on sparse representation and investigate conditions under which the solution of the convex optimization recovers ground-truth representatives of each dataset. We design a loss function whose minimization over the parameters of the data representation network leads to satisfying the theoretical conditions, hence guaranteeing recovering ground- truth summaries. Given the non-convexity of the loss function, we develop an efﬁcient learning scheme that alternates between representation learning by mini- mizing our proposed loss given the current assignments of points to ground-truth representatives and updating assignments given the current data representation.

Sequential data, including time-series and ordered data, contain important structural relation- ships among items, imposed by underlying dynamic models of data, that should play a vital role in the selection of representatives. However, nearly all existing subset selection techniques ignore underlying dynamics of data and treat items independently, leading to incompatible sets of representatives. In this paper, we develop a new framework for sequential subset selection that ﬁnds a set of represen- tatives compatible with the dynamic models of data. To do so, we equip items with transition dynamic models and pose the problem as an integer binary optimization over assignments of sequential items to representatives, that leads to high encoding, diversity and transition potentials. Our formulation generalizes the well-known facility location objective to deal with sequential data, incorporating transition dynamics among facilities. As the proposed formulation is non-convex, we derive a max-sum message passing algorithm to solve the problem efﬁciently. Experiments on synthetic and real data, including instructional video summarization, show that our sequential subset selection framework not only achieves better encoding and diversity than the state of the art, but also successfully incorporates dynamics of data, leading to compatible representatives. 1s and Future Work We developed a new framework for sequential subset selection that takes advantage of the underlying dynamic models of data, promoting to select a set of representatives that are compatible according to the dynamic models of data.

Image to Sphere: Learning Equivariant Features for Efficient Pose Prediction ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_2bDpAtr7PI","Predicting the pose of objects from a single image is an important but difficult computer vision problem. Methods that predict a single point estimate do not predict the pose of objects with symmetries well and cannot represent uncertainty. Alternatively, some works predict a distribution over orientations in SO(3). How- ever, training such models can be computation- and sample-inefficient. Instead, we propose a novel mapping of features from the image domain to the 3D rotation manifold. Our method then leverages SO(3) equivariant layers, which are more sample efficient, and outputs a distribution over rotations that can be sampled at arbitrary resolution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method at object orientation prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the popular PASCAL3D+ dataset. Moreover, we show that our method can model complex object symmetries, without any modifications to the parameters or loss function. Code is available at https://dmklee.github.io/image2sphere. 1In this work, we present the first method to leverage SO(3)-equivariance for predicting distributions over 3D rotations from single images. Our method is better suited than regression methods at handling unknown object symmetries, generates more expressive distributions than methods using parametric families of multi-modal distributions while requiring fewer samples than an implicit modeling approach. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the challenging PASCAL3D+ dataset composed of real images. One limitation of our work is that we use a high maximum frequency, L, in the spherical convolution operations to have higher resolution predictions. Because the number of operations in a spherical convolution is quadratic in L, it may be impractical for applications where more spherical convolutions are required. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023",1835

The motivation for such integration is not only to support in-situ learning, but also to emphasize to students that ethical consideration is inherently part of the technical practice of computing. We propose that the logical place to begin emphasiz- ing ethics is on day one of computing education: in introductory programming classes. This paper presents one approach to ethics integration into such classes: assignments that teach basic program- ming concepts (e.g., conditionals or iteration) but are contextualized with real-world ethical dilemmas or concepts. We report on experi- ences with this approach in multiple introductory programming courses, including details about select assignments, insights from instructors and teaching assistants, and results from surveys of a subset of students who took these courses. Based on these experi- ences we provide preliminary plans for future work, along with a roadmap for instructors to emulate our approach and suggestions for overcoming challenges they might face.

Historically, these services allowed advertisers to select which users see their ads via targeting attributes. Recently, most advertising platforms have begun allowing advertisers to target users directly by uploading the personal information of the users who they wish to advertise to (e.g., their names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.); these services are often known as custom audiences. Custom audiences effectively represent powerful linking mechanisms, allowing advertisers to leverage any PII (e.g., from customer data, public records, etc.) to target users. In this paper, we focus on Facebook’s custom audience implementation and demonstrate attacks that allow an adversary to exploit the interface to infer users’ PII as well as to infer their activity. Speciﬁcally, we show how the adversary can infer users’ full phone numbers knowing just their email address, determine whether a particular user visited a website, and de-anonymize all the visitors to a website by inferring their phone numbers en masse. These attacks can be conducted without any interaction with the victim(s), cannot be detected by the victim(s), and do not require the adversary to spend money or actually place an ad. We propose a simple and effective ﬁx to the attacks based on reworking the way Facebook de-duplicates uploaded information. Facebook’s security team acknowledged the vulnerability and has put into place a ﬁx that is a variant of the ﬁx we propose. Overall, our results indicate that advertising platforms need to carefully consider the privacy implications of their interfaces.The vast amounts of user data that social networking services have collected is now utilized by their advertising platforms to allow advertisers to target users via their PII. In this paper, we have shown how the inclusion of PII-based targeting opens up new privacy leaks in advertising platforms. By giving advertisers ﬁne-grained control over the set of users targeted, and by providing them with coarse-grained statistics of audience sizes, the platforms open themselves to powerful attacks that can let an adversary learn private information about users.

Alarmingly, these surveys also reveal that peo- ple are also unaware of the amount of data sharing that occurs between ad exchanges, and thus underestimate the privacy risks associated with online tracking. In reality, the modern ad ecosystem is fueled by a ﬂow of user data between trackers and ad exchanges. Al- though recent work has shown that ad exchanges rou- tinely perform cookie matching with other exchanges, these studies are based on brittle heuristics that cannot detect all forms of information sharing, especially under adversarial conditions. In this study, we develop a methodology that is able to detect client- and server-side ﬂows of information be- tween arbitrary ad exchanges. Our key insight is to lever- age retargeted ads as a tool for identifying information ﬂows. Intuitively, our methodology works because it re- lies on the semantics of how exchanges serve ads, rather than focusing on speciﬁc cookie matching mechanisms. Using crawled data on 35,448 ad impressions, we show that our methodology can successfully categorize four different kinds of information sharing behavior between ad exchanges, including cases where existing heuristic methods fail. We conclude with a discussion of how our ﬁndings and methodologies can be leveraged to give users more control over what kind of ads they see and how their in- formation is shared between ad exchanges. 1s or recommendations expressed in this mate- rial are those of the authors and do not necessarily reﬂect the views of the NSF.",1842

Symp. on High Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing, Phoenix, AZ, USA, ACM, pp. 49--60, June, 2019","Transparently checkpointing MPI for fault tolerance and load bal- ancing is a long-standing problem in HPC. The problem has been complicated by the need to provide checkpoint-restart services for all combinations of an MPI implementation over all network interconnects. This work presents MANA (MPI-Agnostic Network- Agnostic transparent checkpointing), a single code base which sup- ports all MPI implementation and interconnect combinations. The agnostic properties imply that one can checkpoint an MPI appli- cation under one MPI implementation and perhaps over TCP, and then restart under a second MPI implementation over InfiniBand on a cluster with a different number of CPU cores per node. This tech- nique is based on a novel split-process approach, which enables two separate programs to co-exist within a single process with a single address space. This work overcomes the limitations of the two most widely adopted transparent checkpointing solutions, BLCR and DMTCP/InfiniBand, which require separate modifications to each MPI implementation and/or underlying network AP2 MANA: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Multiple aspects of the design of MANA are covered in this sec- tion. Section 2.1 discusses the design for supporting a split-process. Section 2.2 discusses the need to save and restore persistent MPI opaque objects, such as communicators, groups and topologies. Section 2.3 briefly discusses the commonly used algorithm to drain point-to-point MPI messages in transit prior to intiaiting a check- point. Sections 2.4 and 2.5 present a new two-phase algorithm (Algorithm 2), which enables checkpointing in-progress MPI collec- tive communication calls in a fully agnostic environment. Finally, Sections 2.6 and 2.7 present details of the overall implementation of MANA. 2.1 Upper and Lower Half: Checkpointing with an Ephemeral MPI Library In this section, we define the lower half of a split-process as the memory associated with the MPI library and dependencies, includ- ing network libraries. The upper half is the remaining Linux process memory associated with the MPI application’s code, data, stack, and other regions (e.g., environment variables). The terms lower half and upper half are in analogy with the upper and lower half of a device driver in an operating system kernel. This separation into lower and upper half does not involve additional threads or processes. Instead, it serves primarily to tag memory so that only upper half memory will be saved or restored during checkpoint and restart. Section 2.6 describes an additional “helper thread”, but that thread is active only during checkpoint and restart. Libc and other system libraries may appear in both the lower half as a dependency of the MPI libraries, and the upper half as an independent dependency of the MPI application. This split-process approach allows MANA to balance two con- flicting objectives: a shared address space; and isolation of upper and lower halves. The isolation allows MANA to omit the lower half memory (an “ephemeral” MPI library) when it creates a checkpoint image file. The shared address space allows the flow of control to pass efficiently from the upper-half MPI application to the lower- half MPI library through standard C/Fortran calling conventions, including call by reference. As previously noted, Remote Produce Calls (RPC) are not employed. Isolation is needed so that at checkpoint time, the lower half can be omitted from the checkpoint image, and at the time of restart, replaced with a small “bootstrap” MPI program with new MPI li- braries. The bootstrap program calls MPI_Init() and each MPI process discovers its MPI rank via a call to MPI_Rank(). The mem- ory present at this time becomes the lower half. The MPI process then restores the upper-half memory from a checkpoint image file corresponding to the MPI rank id. Control is then transferred back to the upper-half MPI application, and the stack in the lower half is never used again. Shared address space is needed for efficiency. A dual-process proxy approach was explored in [16, Section IV.B] and in [35, Sec- tion IV.A]. The former work reported a 6% runtime overhead for real-world CUDA applications, and the latter work reported run- time overheads in excess of 20% for some OpenCL examples from the NVIDIA SDK 3.0. In contrast, Section 3 reports runtime over- heads less than 2% for MANA under older Linux kernels, and less than 1% runtime overhead for recent Linux kernels. Discarding the lower half greatly simplifies the task of check- pointing. By discarding the lower half, the MPI application in the upper half appears as an isolated process with no inter-process communication. Therefore, a single-process checkpointing package can create a checkpoint image. A minor inconvenience of this split-process approach is that calls to sbrk() will cause the kernel to extend the process heap in the data segment. Calls to sbrk() can be caused by invocations of malloc(). Since the kernel has no concept of a split-process, the kernel may choose, for example, to extend the lower half data segment after restart since that corresponds to the original program seen by the kernel before the upper-half memory is restored. MANA resolves this by interposing on calls to sbrk() in the upper-half libc, and then inserts calls to mmap() to extend the heap of the upper-half. Finally, MANA employs coordinated checkpointing, and a check- point coordinator sends messages to each MPI rank at the time of checkpoint (see Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5). MPI opaque objects (communicators, groups, topologies) are detected on creation and restored on restart (see Section 2.2). This is part of a broader strat- egy by which MPI calls with persistent effects (such as creation of these opaque objects) are recorded during runtime and replayed on restart. 2.2 Checkpointing MPI Communicators, Groups, and Topologies An MPI application can create communication subgroups and topolo- gies to group processes for ease of programmability and efficient communication. MPI implementations provide opaque handles to the application as a reference to a communicator object or group. MANA interposes on all calls that refer to these opaque identi- fiers, and virtualizes the identifiers. At runtime, MANA records any MPI calls that can modify the MPI communication state, such as MPI_Comm_create, MPI_Group_incl, etc. On restart, MANA recre- ates the MPI communicator state by replaying the MPI calls using a new MPI library. The runtime virtualization of identifiers allows the application to continue running with consistent handles across checkpoint-restart. A similar checkpointing strategy also works for other opaque identifiers, such as, MPI derived datatypes, etc. 2.3 Checkpointing MPI Point-to-Point Communication Capturing the state of MPI processes requires quiescing the process threads, and preserving the process memory to a file on the disk. However, this alone is not sufficient to capture a consistent state of the computation. Any MPI messages sent but not yet received at the time of quiescing processes must also be saved as part of the checkpoint image. MANA employs a variation of an all-to-all bookmark exchange algorithm to reach this consistent state. LAM/MPI [31] demon- strated the efficacy of a such a Chandy/Lamport [11] algorithm for checkpointing MPI applications. Hursey et al. [22] lifted this mechanism out of interconnect drivers and into the MPI library. MANA further lifts this mechanism outside the MPI library, and into a virtualized MPI API. An early prototype of MANA demonstrated a naïve application of this bookmark exchange algorithm was sufficient for handling pre-checkpoint draining for point-to-point communication; how- ever, collective-communication calls may have MPI implementation effects that can determine when it is “safe” to begin a checkpoint. For this reason, a naïve application to the entire API was insufficient to ensure correctness. This is discussed in Section 2.4. 2.4 Checkpointing MPI Collectives: Overview The MPI collective communications primitive involves communi- cation amongst all or a program-defined subset of MPI ranks (as specified by the MPI communicator argument to the function). The internal behavior of collectives are specific to each MPI implemen- tation, and so it is not possible to make guarantees about their behavior, such as when and how messages are exchanged when ranks are waiting for one or more ranks to enter the collective. In prior work [22, 31], internal knowledge of the MPI library state was required to ensure that checkpointing would occur at a “safe” state. In particular, Hursey et al. [22] required interconnect drivers be classified as “checkpoint-friendly” or “checkpoint-unfriendly”, changing behavior based on this classification. As MANA lives outside the MPI library, a naive application of the Hursey et al. algorithm can have effects that cross the upper and lower half boundaries of an MPI rank (for example, when shared memory is being used for MPI communication). This problem occurs because of the truly network-agnostic trait of MANA. As MANA has no concept of transport level constructs, it cannot determine what “safe” means in context of collectives. To correct this, MANA’s support for collective communication requires it to maintain the following invariant: No checkpoint must take place while a rank is inside a collective communication call. There exists one exception to this rule: a trivial barrier. A trivial barrier is a simple call to MPI_Barrier(). This call produces no side effects on an MPI rank, and so it can be safely interrupted during checkpoint, and then re-issued when restarting the MPI application. This is possible due to the split-process architecture of MANA, as trivial barrier calls occur exclusively in the lower half, which is discarded and replaced across checkpoint and restart. MANA leverages this exception to build a solution for all other collective calls. As we discuss MANA’s algorithm for checkpointing collective calls, we take into consideration three subtle, but important, con- cerns. Challenge I (consistency): In the case of a single MPI collec- tive communication call, there is a danger that rank A will see a request to checkpoint before entering the collective call, while rank B will see the same request after entering the collective call, in violation of MANA’s invariant. Both ranks might report that they are ready to checkpoint, and the resulting inconsistent snapshot will create problems during restart. This situation could arise, for example, if the mes- sage from the checkpoint coordinator to rank B is excessively delayed in the network. To resolve this, MANA introduces a two-pass protocol in which the coordinator makes a re- quest (sends an intend-to-checkpoint message), each MPI rank acknowledges with its current state, and finally the coordinator posts a checkpoint request (possibly preceded by extra iterations). Challenge II (progress and latency): Given the aforementioned solution for consistency, long delays may occur before a checkpoint request can be serviced. It may be that rank A has entered the barrier, and rank B will require several hours to finish a task before entering the barrier. Hence, the two-pass protocol may create unacceptable delays before a checkpoint can be taken. Algorithm 2 addresses this by introducing a trivial barrier prior to the collective communication call. We refer to this as a two-phase algorithm since each collective call is now replaced by a wrapper function that invokes a trivial barrier call (phase 1) followed by the original collective call (phase 2). Challenge III (multiple collective calls): Until now, it was assumed that at most one MPI collective communication call was in progress at the time of checkpoint. It may happen that there are multiple ongoing collective calls. During the time that some MPI ranks exit from a collective call, it may happen that MPI ranks associated with an independent col- lective call have left the MPI trivial barrier (phase 1) and have now entered the real collective call (phase 2). As a result, servicing a checkpoint may be excessive delayed. To solve this, we introduce an intend-to-checkpoint message, such that no ranks will be allowed to enter phase 2, and extra itera- tions will be inserted into the request-acknowledge protocol between coordinator and MPI rank. 2.5 Checkpointing MPI Collectives: Detailed Algorithm Here we present a single algorithm (Algorithm 2) for checkpointing MPI collectives which contains the elements described in Section 2.4: a multi-iteration protocol; and a two-phase algorithm incorporating a trivial barrier before any collective communication call. From the viewpoint of an MPI application, any call to an MPI collective communication function is interposed on by a wrapper function, as shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Two-Phase collective communication wrapper. (This wrapper function interposes on all MPI collective com- munication functions invoked by an MPI application) 1: function Collective Communication Wrapper 2: # Begin Phase 1 3: Call MPI_Barrier() # trivial barrier 4: # Begin Phase 2 5: Call original MPI collective communication function 6: end function Recall that a trivial barrier is an extra call to MPI_Barrier() prior to a collective call. A collective MPI call can intuitively be divided into two parts: the participating MPI ranks “register” themselves as ready for the collective communication; and then the “work” of communication is carried out. Where the time for the collective communication calls of an MPI program is significant, it is typically due to significant “work” in the second part of the calls. Adding a trivial barrier requires the MPI ranks to register themselves once for the trvial barrier (but no work is involved), and then register themselves again for the actual MPI collective communication. The overhead due to registering twice is tiny in practice. Evidence for this can be seen in the experiments in Section 3.2.3, which show small overhead. The purpose of Algorithm 1 is to enforce the following extension of the invariant presented in Section 2.4: No checkpoint must take place while a rank is inside the collective communication call (Phase 2) of a wrapper function for collective communication (Algorithm 1). We formalize this with the following theorem, which guarantees Algorithm 2 satisfies this invariant. Theorem 1. Under Algorithm 2, an MPI rank is never inside a collective communication call when a checkpoint message is received from the checkpoint coordinator. The proof of this theorem is deferred until the end of this sub- section. We begin the path to this proof by stating an axiom that serves to define the concept of a barrier. Axiom 1. For a given invocation of an MPI barrier, it never happens that a rank A exits from the barrier before another rank B enters the barrier under the “happens-before” relation. Next, we present the following two lemmas. Checkpoint Coordinator Rank A Rank B Barrier (1) (3) (2) (4) Figure 1: Fundamental “happens-before” relation in commu- nication between the checkpoint coordinator and the MPI ranks involved in an MPI barrier. Lemma 1. For a given MPI barrier, if the checkpoint coordinator sends a message to each MPI rank participating in the barrier, and if at least one of the reply messages from the participating ranks reports that its rank has exited the barrier, then the MPI coordinator can send a second message to each participating rank, and each MPI rank will reply that it has entered the barrier (and perhaps also exited the barrier). Proof. We prove the lemma by contradiction. Suppose that the lemma does not hold. Figure 1 shows the general case in which this happens. At event 4, the checkpoint coordinator will conclude that event 1 (rank A has exited the MPI barrier) happened before event 2 (the first reply by each rank), which happened before event 3 (in which rank B has not yet entered the barrier). But this contradicts Axiom 1. Therefore, our assumption is false, and the lemma does indeed hold. □ Lemma 2. Recall that an MPI collective communication wrapper makes a call to a trivial barrier and then makes an MPI collective communication call. For a given invocation of an MPI collective com- munication wrapper, we know that one of four cases must hold: (a) an MPI rank is in the collective communication call, and all other ranks are either in the call, or have exited; (b) an MPI rank is in the collective communication call, and no rank has exited, and every other rank has at least entered the trivial barrier (and possibly proceeded further); (c) an MPI rank is in the trivial barrier and no other rank has exited (but some may not yet have entered the trivial barrier); (d) either no MPI rank has entered the trivial barrier, or all MPI ranks have exited the MPI collective communication call. Proof. The proof is by repeated application of Lemma 1. For case a, if an MPI rank is in the collective communication call and another rank has exited the collective call, then Lemma 1 says that there cannot be any rank that has not yet entered the collective call. For case b, note that if an MPI rank is in the collective communi- cation call, then that rank has exited the trivial barrier. Therefore, by Lemma 1, all other ranks have at least entered the trivial barrier. Further, we can assume that no ranks that have exited the collec- tive call, since we would otherwise be in case a, which is already accounted for. For case c, note that if an MPI rank is in the trivial barrier and no rank has exited the trivial barrier, then Lemma 1 says that there cannot be any rank that has not yet entered the trivial barrier. Finally, if we are not in case a, b, or c, then the only remaining possibility is case d: all ranks have not yet entered the trivial barrier or all ranks have exited the collective call. □ Algorithm 2 Two-Phase algorithm for deadlock-free check- pointing of MPI collectives 1: Messages: {intend-to-checkpoint, extra-iteration, do-ckpt} 2: MPI states: {ready, in-phase-1, exit-phase-2} 3: Process Checkpoint Coordinator do 4: function Begin Checkpoint 5: send intend-to-ckpt msg to all ranks 6: receive responses from each rank 7: while some rank in state exit-phase-2 do 8: send extra-iteration msg to all ranks 9: receive responses from each rank 10: end while 11: send do-ckpt msg to all ranks 12: end function 13: Process MPI Rank do 14: upon event intend-to-ckpt msg or extra-iteration msg do 15: if not inCollectiveWrapper then 16: reply to ckpt coord: state ←ready 17: end if 18: if inCollectiveWrapper and in Phase 1 then 19: reply to ckpt coord: state ←in-phase-1 20: end if 21: if inCollectiveWrapper and in Phase 2 then 22: # guaranteed ckpt coord won’t request ckpt here 23: finish executing coll. comm. call 24: reply to ckpt coord: state ←exit-phase-2 25: # ckpt coord can request ckpt after this 26: set state ←ready 27: end if 28: continue, but wait before next coll. comm. call 29: upon event do-ckpt msg do 30: # guaranteed now that no rank is in phase 2 during ckpt 31: do local checkpoint for this rank 32: # all ranks may now continue executing 33: if this rank is waiting before coll. comm. call then 34: unblock this rank and continue executing 35: end if We now continue with the proof of the main theorem (Theo- rem 1), which was deferred earlier. Proof. (Proof of Theorem 1 for Algorithm 2.) Lemma 2 states that one of four cases must hold in a call by MANA to an MPI collective communication wrapper. We wish to exclude the possibility that an MPI rank is in the collective communication call (case a or b of the lemma) when the checkpoint coordinator invokes a checkpoint. In Algorithm 2, assume that the checkpoint coordinator has sent an intend-to-ckpt message, and has not yet sent a do-ckpt message. An MPI rank will either reply with state ready or in-phase-1 (show- ing that it is not in the collective communication call and that it will stop before entering the collective communication call), or else it must be in Phase 2 of the wrapper (potentially within the collective communication call), and it will not reply to the coordinator until exiting the collective call. □ Theorem 2. Under Algorithm 2, deadlock will never occur. Further, the delay between the time when all ranks have received the intend- to-checkpoint message and the time when the do-ckpt message has been sent is bounded by the maximum time for any individual MPI rank to enter and exit the collective communication call, plus network message latency. Proof. The algorithm will never deadlock, since each rank must either make progress based on the normal MPI operation or else it stops before the collective communication call. If any rank replies with the state exit-phase-2, then the checkpoint coordinator will send an additional extra-iteration message. So, at the time of check- point, all ranks will have state ready or in-phase-1. Next, the delay between the time when all ranks have received the intend-to-checkpoint message and the time when the do-ckpt message has been sent is clearly bounded by the maximum time for an individual MPI rank to enter and exit the collective commu- nication call, plus the usual network message latency. This is the case since once the intend-to-checkpoint message is received, no MPI rank may enter the collective communication call. So, upon re- ceiving the intend-to-checkpoint message, either the rank is already in Phase 2 or else it will remain in Phase 1. □ Implementation of Algorithm 2: At the time of process launch for an MPI rank, a separate checkpoint helper thread is also in- jected into each rank. This thread is responsible for listening to checkpoint-related messages from a separate coordinator process and then responding. This allows the MPI rank to asynchronously process events based on messages received from the checkpoint coordinator. Furthermore at the time of checkpoint, the existing threads of the MPI rank process are quiesced (paused) by the helper thread, and the helper thread carries out the checkpointing require- ments, such as copying the upper-half memory regions to stable storage. The coordinator process does not participate in the check- pointing directly. In the implementation, a DMTCP coordinator and DMTCP checkpoint thread [1] are modified to serve as checkpoint coordinator and helper thread, respectively. 2.6 Verification with TLA+/PlusCal To gain further confidence in our implementation for handling collective communication (Section 2.5), we developed a model for the protocol in TLA+ [25] and then used the PlusCal model checker of TLA+ based on TLC [38] to verify Algorithm 2. Specifically, PlusCal was used to verify the algorithm invariants of deadlock- free execution and consistent state when multiple concurrent MPI processes are executing. The PlusCal model checker did not report any deadlocks or broken invariants for our implementation. 2.7 Checkpoint/Restart Package Any single-process checkpointing package could be utilized for the basis of implementing MANA. This work presents a prototype implemented by extending DMTCP [1] and by developing a DMTCP plugin [2]. Cao et al. [9] demonstrated that DMTCP can checkpoint MPI-based HPCG over 32,752 CPU cores (38 TB) in 11 minutes, and MPI-based NAMD over 16,368 cores (10 TB) in 2.6 minutes. DMTCP uses a helper thread inside each application process, and a coordinated checkpointing protocol by using a centralized coor- dinator daemon. Since this was close to the design requirements of MANA, we leveraged this infrastructure and extended the DMTCP coordinator to implement the two-phase algorithm. The same approach could be extended to base MANA on top of a different underlying transparent checkpointing package. For example, one could equally well have modified an existing MPI co- ordinator process to communicate with a custom helper thread in each MPI rank that then invokes the BLCR checkpointing package when it is required to execute the checkpoint. In particular, all sock- ets and other network communication objects are inside the lower half, and so even a single-process or single-host checkpointing package such as BLCR would suffice for this work. 3 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION This section seeks to answer the following questions: Q1: What is the runtime overhead of running MPI applications under MANA? Q2: What are the checkpoint and restart overheads of transparent checkpointing of MPI applications under MANA? Q3: Can MANA allow transparent switching of MPI implementa- tions across checkpoint-restart for the purpose of load balancing? 3.1 Setup We first describe the hardware and software setup for MANA’s evaluation. 3.1.1 Hardware. The experiments were run on the Cori supercom- puter [13] at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). As of this writing, Cori is the #12 supercomputer in the Top-500 list [36]. All experiments used the Intel Haswell nodes (dual socket with a 16-core Xeon E5-2698 v3 each) connected via Cray’s Aries interconnect network. Checkpoints were saved to the backend Lustre filesystem. 3.1.2 Software. Cori provides modules for two implementations of MPI: Intel MPI and Cray MPICH. The Cray compiler (based on an Intel compiler) and Cray MPICH are the recommended way to use MPI, presumably for reasons of performance. Cray MPICH version 3.0 was used for the experiments. 3.1.3 Application Benchmarks. MANA was tested with five real- world HPC applications from different computational science do- mains: (1) GROMACS [4]: Versatile package for molecular dynamics, often used for biochemical molecules. (2) CLAMR [12, 29]: Mini-application for CelL-based Adaptive Mesh Refinement. 90 95 100 Normalized Performance (%) GROMACS miniFE HPCG CLAMR LULESH 1 2 4 8 16 32 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 1 2 4 8 16 32 # MPI Rank(s) (Single node) 1 2 4 8 16 32 1 9 27 Figure 2: Single Node: Runtime overhead under MANA for different real-world HPC benchmarks with an unpatched Linux kernel.

(4) LULESH [24]: Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hy- drodynamics (5) HPCG [14] (High Performance Conjugate Gradient): Uses a variety of linear algebra operations to match a broad set of important HPC applications, and used for ranking HPC systems. 3.2 Runtime Overhead 3.2.1 Real-world HPC Applications. Next, we evaluate the perfor- mance of MANA for real-world HPC applications. It will be shown that the runtime overhead is close to 0 % for miniFE and HPCG, and as much as 2 % for the other three applications. The higher overhead has been tracked down to an inefficiency in the Linux ker- nel [27] in the case of many point-to-point MPI calls (send/receive) with messages of small size. This worst case is analyzed further in Section 3.3, where tests with an optimized Linux kernel show a worst case runtime overhead of 0.6 %. The optimized Linux kernel is based on a patch under review for a future Linux version. Single Node: Since the tests were performed within a larger clus- ter where the network use of other jobs could create congestion, we first eliminate any network-related overhead by running the benchmarks on a single node with multiple MPI ranks, both under 0 1000000 2000000 3000000 4000000 Size (Bytes) 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 Bandwidth (MB/s) Without MANA With MANA (native kernel) With MANA (patched kernel) Figure 4: Point-to-Point Bandwidth under MANA with patched and unpatched Linux kernel. (Higher is better.) MANA and natively (without MANA). This experiment isolates the single-node runtime overhead of MANA by ensuring that all communication among ranks is intra-node. Figure 2 shows the results for the five different real-world HPC applications running on a single node under MANA. Each run was repeated 5 times (including the native runs), and the figure shows the mean of the 5 runs. The absolute runtimes varied from 4.5 min to 15 min, depending on the configuration. The worst case overhead incurred by MANA is 2.1 % in the case of GROMACS (with 16 MPI ranks). In most cases, the mean overhead is less than 2 %. Multiple Nodes: Next, the scaling of MANA across the network is examined for up to 64 compute nodes and with 32 ranks per node (except for LULESH, whose configuration restricts the number of ranks/node based on the number of nodes). Hence, the number of MPI ranks ranges from 64 to 2048. Figure 3 shows the results of five different real-world HPC ap- plications running on multiple nodes under MANA. Each run was repeated 5 times, and the mean of 5 runs is reported. We observe a trend similar to the single node case. MANA imposes an overhead of typically less than 2 %. The highest overhead observed is 4.5 % in the case of GROMACS (512 ranks running over 16 nodes). However, see Section 3.3 where we demonstrate a reduced overhead of 0.6 % with GROMACS. 3.2.2 Memory Overhead. The upper-half libraries were built with mpicc, and hence include additional copies of the MPI library that are not used. However, the upper-half MPI library is never ini- tialized, and so no network library is ever loaded into the upper half. Since a significant portion of the lower half is comprised only of the MPI library and its dependencies, the additional copy of the libraries (with one copy residing in the upper half) imposes a constant memory overhead. This text segment (code region) was 26 MB in all of our experiments on Cori with the Cray MPI library. In addition to the code, the libraries (for example, the networking driver library) in the lower half also allocate additional memory regions (shared memory regions, pinned memory regions, memory- mapped driver regions). We observed that the shared memory re- gions mapped by the network driver library grow in proportion with the number of nodes (up to 64 nodes): from 2 MB (for 2 nodes) to 40 MB for (64 nodes). We expect MANA to have a reduced check- point time compared to DMTCP/InfiniBand [10], as MANA discards these regions during checkpointing, reducing the amount of data that’s written out to the disk. 0 1000000 2000000 3000000 4000000 Size (Bytes) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Latency (µs) Without MANA With MANA (a) Point-to-Point Latency 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 1000000 Size (Bytes) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Latency (µs) Without MANA With MANA (b) Collective MPI_Gather 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 1000000 Size (Bytes) 0 100 200 300 400 500 Latency (µs) Without MANA With MANA (c) Collective MPI_Allreduce Figure 5: OSU Micro-benchmarks under MANA. (Results are for two MPI ranks on a single node.) 3.2.3 Microbenchmarks. To dig deeper into the sources for the run- time overhead, we tested MANA with the OSU micro-benchmarks. The benchmarks stress and evaluate the bandwidth and latency of different specific MPI subsystems. Our choice of the specific micro-benchmarks was motivated by the MPI calls commonly used by our real-world MPI applications. Figure 5 shows the results with three benchmarks from the OSU micro-benchmark suite. These benchmarks correspond with the most frequently used MPI subsystems in the set of real-world HPC applications. The benchmarks were run with 2 MPI ranks running on a single compute node. The results show that latency does not suffer under MANA, for both point-to-point and collective communication. (The latency curves for application running under MANA closely follow the curves when the application is run natively.) 3.3 Source of Overhead and Improved Overhead for Patched Linux Kernel All experiments in this section were performed on a single node of our local cluster, where it was possible to directly install a patched Linux kernel in the bare machine. Further investigation revealed two sources of runtime overhead. The larger source of overhead is due to the use of the “FS” register during transfer of flow of control between the upper and lower half and back during a call to the MPI library in the lower half. The “FS” register of the x86-64 CPU is used by most compilers to refer to the thread-local variables declared in the source code. The upper and lower half programs each have their own thread-local storage region. Hence, when switching between the upper and lower half programs, the value of the “FS” register must be changed to point to the correct thread-local region. Most Linux kernels today require a kernel call to invoke a privileged assembly instruction to get or set the “FS” register. In 2011, Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs introduced a new, unprivileged FSGSBASE assembly instruction for modifying the “FS” register, and a patch to the Linux kernel [27] is under review to allow other Linux programs to use this more efficient mechanism for managing the “FS” register. (Other architectures, such as ARM, use unprivileged addressing modes for thread-local variables that do not depend on special constructs, such as the x86 segments.) A second (albeit smaller) source of overhead is the virtualization of MPI communicators and datatypes, and recording of metadata for MPI sends and receives. Virtualization requires a hash table lookup and locks for thread safety. The first and larger source of overhead is then eliminated by using the patched Linux kernel, as discussed above. Point-to-point bandwidth benchmarks were run both with and without the patched Linux kernel (Figure 4). A degradation in runtime performance is seen for MANA for small message sizes (less than 1 MB) in the case of a native kernel. However, the figure shows that the patched kernel yields much reduced runtime overhead for MANA. Note that the Linux kernel community is actively reviewing this patch (currently in its third version), and it is likely to be incorporated in future Linux releases. Finally, we return to GROMACS, since it exhibited a higher runtime overhead (e.g., 2.1 % in the case of 16 ranks) in many cases. We did a similar experiment, running GROMACS with 16 MPI ranks on a single node with the patched kernel. With the patched kernel, the performance degradation was reduced to 0.6 %. 3.4 Checkpoint-restart Overhead In this section, we evaluate MANA’s performance when checkpoint- ing and restarting HPC applications. Figure 6 shows the checkpoint- ing overhead for five different real-world HPC applications running on multiple nodes under MANA. Each run was repeated 5 times, and the mean of five runs is reported. For each run, we use the fsync system call to ensure the data is flushed to the Lustre backend storage. The total checkpointing data written at each checkpoint varies from 5.9 GB (in the case of 64 ranks of GROMACS running over 2 nodes) to 4 TB (in the case of 2048 ranks of HPCG running over 64 nodes). Note that the checkpointing overhead is proportional to the total amount of memory used by the benchmark. This is also reflected in the size of the checkpoint image per MPI rank. While Figure 6 reports the overall checkpoint time, note that there is significant variation in the write times for each MPI rank during a given run. (The time for one rank to write its checkpoint data can be up to 4 times more than that for 90 % of the other ranks.) This phenomenon of stragglers during a parallel write has also been noted by other researchers [2, 37]. Thus, the overall checkpoint time is bottlenecked by the checkpoint time of the slowest rank. Next, we ask what are the sources of the checkpointing overhead? Does the draining of MPI messages and the two-phase algorithm impose a significant overhead at checkpoint time? 2 4 8 16 32 64 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Checkpoint Time (s) (93 MB) (93 MB) (92 MB) (92 MB) (94 MB) (92 MB) GROMACS 2 4 8 16 32 64 (2.0 GB) (1.3 GB) (806 MB) (1.3 GB) (902 MB) (1.3 GB) miniFE 2 4 8 16 32 64 # Compute Nodes (32 ranks/node, except LULESH) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) HPCG 2 4 8 16 32 64 (656 MB) (594 MB) (552 MB) (501 MB) (594 MB) (552 MB) CLAMR 2 4 8 16 32 64 (276 MB) (164 MB) (114 MB) (91 MB) (85 MB) (88 MB) LULESH Figure 6: Checkpointing overhead and checkpoint image sizes under MANA for different real-world HPC bench- marks running on multiple nodes. In all cases, except LULESH, 32 MPI ranks were executed on each compute node. For LULESH, the total number of ranks was either 64 (for 2, 4, and 8 nodes), or 512 (for 16, 32, and 64 nodes). Hence, the maximum number of ranks (for 64 nodes) was 2048. The numbers above the bars (in parentheses) indicate the check- point image size for each MPI rank. 2 4 8 16 32 64 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 Restart Time (s) GROMACS 2 4 8 16 32 64 miniFE 2 4 8 16 32 64 # Compute Nodes (32 ranks/node, except LULESH) HPCG 2 4 8 16 32 64 CLAMR 2 4 8 16 32 64 LULESH Figure 7: Restart overhead under MANA for different real- world HPC benchmarks running on multiple nodes. In all cases, except LULESH, 32 MPI ranks were executed on each compute node. Ranks/node is as in Figure 6. Figure 8 shows the contribution of different components to the checkpointing overhead for the case of 64 nodes for the five different benchmarks. In all cases, the communication overhead for handling MPI collectives in the two-phase algorithm of Section 2.5 is found to be less than 1.6 s. In all cases, the time to drain in-flight MPI messages was less than 0.7 s. The total checkpoint time was dominated by the time to write to the storage system.

The communi- cation overhead is the time required in the protocol for net- work communication between the checkpoint coordinator and each rank. overhead was the communication overhead. The current imple- mentation of the checkpointing protocol in DMTCP uses TCP/IP sockets for communication between the MPI ranks and the central- ized DMTCP coordinator. The communication overhead associated with the TCP layer is found to increase with the number of ranks, especially due to metadata in the case of small messages that are exchanged between MPI ranks and the coordinator. Finally, Figure 7 shows the restart overhead under MANA for the different MPI benchmarks. The restart time varies from less than 10 s to 68 s (for 2048 ranks of HPCG running over 64 nodes). The restart times increase in proportion to the total amount of checkpointing data that is read from the storage. In all the cases, the restart overhead is dominated by the time to read the data from the disk. The time to recreate the MPI opaque identifiers (see Section 2.2) is less than 10 % of the total restart time. 3.5 Transparent Switching of MPI libraries across Checkpoint-restart This section demonstrates that MANA can transparently switch between different MPI implementations across checkpoint-restart. This is useful for debugging programs (even the MPI library) as it allows a program to switch from a production version of an MPI library to a debug version of the MPI library. The GROMACS application is launched using the production version of CRAY MPI, and a checkpoint is taken 55 s into the run. The computation is then restarted on top of a custom-compiled debug version of MPICH (for MPICH version 3.3). MPICH was chosen because it is a reference implementation whose simplicity makes it easy to instrument for debugging. 3.6 Transparent Migration across Clusters Next, we consider cross-cluster migration for purposes of wide- area load balancing either among clusters at a single HPC site or even among multiple HPC sites. This is rarely done, since the two common vehicles for transparent checkpoint (BLCR as the base of 190 200 210 220 Runtime (s) Native Restarted (migrated from Cori) Open MPI/IB (2x4) MPICH/TCP (2x4) MPICH (8x1) Restart Configuration 0 Figure 9: Performance degradation of GROMACS after cross- cluster migration under three different restart configura- tions. The application was restarted after being check- pointed at the half-way mark on Cori. (Lower is better.) an MPI-specific checkpoint-restart service; or DMTCP/InfiniBand) both save the MPI library within the checkpoint image and continue to use that same MPI library on the remote cluster after migration. At each site and for each cluster, administrators typically configure and tune a locally recommended MPI implementation for perfor- mance. Migrating an MPI application along with its underlying MPI library destroys the benefit of this local performance tuning. This experiment showcases the benefits of MPI-agnostic, network- agnostic support for transparent checkpointing. GROMACS is run under MANA, initially running on Cori with a statically linked Cray MPI library running over the Cray Aries network. GROMACS on Cori is configured to run with 8 ranks over 4 nodes (2 ranks per node). Each GROMACS rank is single-threaded. A checkpoint was then taken exactly half way into the run. The checkpoints were then migrated to a local cluster that uses Open MPI over the InfiniBand network. The restarted GROMACS under MANA was compared with three other configurations: GROMACS using the local Open MPI, con- figured to use the local InfiniBand network (8 ranks over 2 nodes); GROMACS/MPICH, configured to use TCP (8 ranks over 2 nodes); and GROMACS/MPICH, running on a single node (8 ranks over 1 node). The network-agnostic nature of MANA allowed the Cori version of GROMACS to be restarted on the local cluster with any of three network options. We wished to isolate the effects due to MANA from the effects due to different compilers on Cori and the local cluster. In order to accomplish this, the native GROMACS on the local cluster was com- piled specially. The Cray compiler of Cori (using Intel’s C compiler) was used to generate object files (.o files) on Cori. Those object files were copied to the local cluster. The native GROMACS was then built using the local mpicc, but with the (.o files) as input instead of the (.c files). The local mpicc linked these files with the local MPI implementation, and the native application was then launched in the traditional way. Figure 9 shows that GROMACS’s performance degrades by less than 1.8% post restart on the local cluster for the three different restart configurations (compared to the corresponding native runs). Also, note that the performance of GROMACS under MANA post restart closely tracks the performance of the native configuration. 4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK Next, we discuss both the limitations and some future implications of this work concerning dynamic load balancing. 4.1 Limitations While the split-process approach for checkpointing and process migration is quite flexible, it does include some limitations inherited by any approach based on transparent checkpointing. Naturally, when restarting on a different architecture, the CPU instruction set must be compatible. In particular, on the x86 architecture, the MPI application code must be compiled to the oldest x86 sub-architecture among those remote clusters where one might consider restarting a checkpoint image. (However, the MPI libraries themselves may be fully optimized for the local architecture, since restarting on a remote cluster implies using a new lower half.) Similarly, while MPI implies a standard API, any local extensions to MPI must be avoided. The application binary interface (ABI) used by the compiled MPI application must either be compatible or else a “shim” layer of code must be inserted in the wrapper functions for calling from the upper half to the lower half. And of course, the use of a checkpoint coordinator implies coor- dinated checkpointing. If a single MPI rank crashes, MANA must restore the entire MPI computation from an earlier checkpoint. 4.2 Future Work MPI version 3 has added nonblocking collective communication calls (e.g., MPI_Igather). In future work, we propose to extend the two-phase algorithm for collective communication of Section 2.5 to the nonblocking case. The approach to be explored would be to employ a first phase that uses a nonblocking trivial barrier (MPI_Ibarrier), and to then convert the actual asynchronous col- lective call to a synchronous collective call (e.g., MPI_Gather to MPI_Igather) for the second phase. Nonblocking variations of col- lective communication calls are typically used as performance op- timizations in an MPI application. If an MPI rank reaches the col- lective communication early, then instead of blocking, it can con- tinue with an alternate compute task while occasionally testing (via MPI_Test/MPI_Wait) to see if the other ranks have all reached the barrier. In the two-phase analog, a wrapper around the nonblocking collective communication causes MPI_Ibarrier to be invoked. When the ranks have all reached the nonblocking trivial barrier and the MPI_Test/MPI_Wait calls of the original MPI application reports completion of the MPI_Ibarrier call of phase 1, then this implies that the ranks are all ready to enter the actual collective call of phase 2. A wrapper around MPI_Test/MPI_Wait can then invoke the actual collective call of phase 2. The split-process approach of MANA opens up some impor- tant new features in managing long-running MPI applications. An immediately obvious feature is the possibility of switching in the middle of a long run to a customized MPI implementation. Hence, one can dynamically substitute a customized MPI for performance analysis (e.g., using PMPI for profiling or tracing); or using a spe- cially compiled “debug” version of MPI to analyze a particular but occurring in the MPI library in the middle of a long run. This work also helps support many tools and proposals for opti- mizing MPI applications. For example, a trace analyzer is sometimes used to discover communication hotspots and opportunities for bet- ter load balancing. Such results are then fed back by re-configuring the binding of MPI ranks to specific hosts in order to better fit the underlying interconnect topology. MANA can enable new approaches to dynamically load balance across clusters and also to re-bind MPI ranks in the middle of a long run to create new configurations of rank-to-host bindings (new topology mappings). Currently, such bindings are chosen statically and used for the entire lifetime of the MPI application run. This added flexibility allows system managers to burst current long- running applications into the Cloud during periods of heavy usage or when the the MPI application enters a new phase for which a different rank-to-host binding is optimal. Finally, MANA can enable a new class of very long-running MPI applications — ones which may outlive the lifespan of the original MPI Implementation, cluster, or even the network interconnect. Such temporally complex computations might be discarded as in- feasible today without the ability to migrate MPI implementations or clusters. 5 RELATED WORK Hursey et al. [22] developed a semi-network-agnostic checkpoint service for Open-MPI. It applied an “MPI Message” abstraction to a Chandy/Lamport algorithm [11], greatly reducing the complexity to support checkpoint/restart for many multiple network intercon- nects. However, it also highlighted the weakness of implementing transparent checkpointing within the MPI library, since porting to an additional MPI implementation would likely require as much software development as for the first MPI implementation. Addi- tionally, its dependence on BLCR imposed a large overhead cost, as it lacks support for SysV shared memory. Separate proxy processes for high- and low-level operations have been proposed both by CRUM (for CUDA) and McKernel (for the Linux kernel). CRUM [16] showed that by running a non-reentrant library in a separate process, one can work around the problem of a library “polluting” the address space of the application process — i.e., creating and leaving side-effects in the application process’s address space. This decomposition of a single application process into two processes, however, forces the transfer of data between two processes via RPC, which can cause a large overhead. McKernel [17] runs a “lightweight” kernel along with a full- fledged Linux kernel. The HPC application runs on the lightweight kernel, which implements time-critical system calls. The rest of the functionality is offloaded to a proxy process running on the Linux kernel. The proxy process is mapped in the address space of the main application, similar to MANA’s concept of a lower half, to min- imize the overhead of “call forwarding” (argument marshalling/un- marshalling). In general, a proxy process approach is problematic for MPI, since it can lead to additional jitter as the operating system tries to schedule the extra proxy process alongside the application pro- cess. The jitter harms performance since the MPI computation is constrained to complete no faster than its slowest MPI rank. Process-in-process [21] has in common with MANA that both approaches load multiple programs into a single address space. However, the goal of process-in-process was intra-node communi- cation optimization, and not checkpoint-restart. Process-in-process loads all MPI ranks co-located on the same node as separate threads within a single process, but in different logical “namespaces”, in the sense of the dlmopen namespaces in Linux. It would be diffi- cult to adapt process-in-process for use in checkpoint-restart since that approach implies a single “ld.so” run-time linker library that managed all of the MPI ranks. In particular, difficulties occur when restarting with fresh MPI libraries while “ld.so” retains pointers to destructor functions in the pre-checkpoint MPI libraries. In the special regime of application-specific checkpointing for bulk synchronous MPI applications, Sultana et al. [33] supported checkpointing by separately saving and restoring MPI state (MPI identifiers such as communicators, and so on). This is combined with application-specific code to save the application state. Thus, when a live process fails, it is restored using these two components, without the need restart the overall MPI job. SCR [32], and FTI [3] are other application-specific checkpoint- ing techniques. An application developer declares memory regions they’d like to checkpoint and checkpointing can only be done at specific points in the program determined by the application devel- oper. Combining these techniques with transparent checkpointing is outside the scope of this work, though it is an interesting avenue for further inquiry. In general, application-specific and transparent checkpointing each have their merits. Both application-specific and transparent checkpointing are used in practice. At the high end of HPC, application-specific checkpointing is preferred since the labor for supporting this is small compared to the labor already invested in supporting an extreme HPC application. At the low and medium end of HPC, developers prefer trans- parent checkpointing because the development effort for the soft- ware is more moderate, and the labor overhead of a specialized application-specific checkpointing solution would then be signif- icant. System architectures based on burst buffers (e.g., Cray’s DataWarp [19]) can be used to reduce the checkpointing overhead for both application-specific and transparent checkpointing. 6 CONCLUSION This work presents an MPI-Agnostic, Network-Agnostic transpar- ent checkpointing methodology for MPI (MANA), based on a split- process mechanism. The runtime overhead is typically less than 2%, even in spite of the overhead incurred by the current Linux ker- nel when the “FS” register is modified each time control passes between upper and lower half. Further, Section 3.3 shows that a commit (patch) to fix this by the Linux kernel developers is un- der review and that this commit reduces the runtime overhead of GROMACS from 2.1% to 0.6% using the patched kernel. Similar reductions to about 0.6% runtime overhead are expected in the general case. An additional major novelty is the demonstration of practical, efficient migration between clusters at different sites using differ- ent networks and different configurations of CPU cores per node. This was considered impractical in the past because a checkpoint image from one cluster will not be tuned for optimal performance on the second cluster. Section 3.6 demonstrates that this is now feasible, and that the migration of a GROMACS job with 8 MPI ranks experiences an average runtime overhead of less than 1.8% as compared to the native GROMACS application (without MANA) on the remote cluster. As before, even this overhead of 1.8% is likely to be reduced to about 0.6% in the future, based on the results of Section 3.3 with a patched Linux kernel.",1849

Over time, the software testbench-based emulation environments have become very popular, since the users can control its operation remotely from their desktops. This makes emulators an enterprise resource, accessible to a multitude of users spread across continents and multiple time zones. And since emulators are expensive resources, it is important to utilize them efficiently. Full checkpoint save/restore capability of emulation jobs helps the utilization by enabling flexible job scheduling, shortening of jobs by jumping ahead to interesting points for debug, carrying out what-if analysis, etc. Emulators have native save/restore capabilities for the model on the emulator. The software testbenches can be complex in multiple dimensions. For example, they may be using C/C++, SystemC, SystemVerilog, etc. They may be multi- threaded and based on multiple processes, they may be using IPC, and so on. It then becomes a challenge to save the states of such sophisticated software testbenches both transparently and through a uniform, reliable, mechanism. Since the objective is to solve the problem at an enterprise level, it is critical to find a uniform solution for a diverse set of software testbenches throughout the enterprise. The DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) package supports such a uniform solution. This paper describes the integration of DMTCP with a virtual testbench-based emulation. This brings large benefits to a real life environment that includes multiple emulators within the larger set of enterprise resources. There are other, additional applications of full checkpoint save/restore for emulation jobs that become apparent only after having gained experience with its use in job management. For example, after having observed the behavior of an application prior to checkpoint, additional triggers can be inserted at the time of restore, to enhance debugging of an exception or other unusual behavior.s. II. BACKGROUND: CO-MODELING AND DMTCP A. Review of Co-Modeling Architecture Co-emulation, or (transaction-level) Co-Modeling, is the process of modeling cycle-accurate synthesizable hardware models (DUTs) running on an emulator, communicating with testbenches at transaction level via a high- speed link between the emulator and the host system. The reusable testbenches are interfaced to synthesizable transactors co-located with the DUT in the emulator. These “accelerated” transactors convert high-level transactions to signal-level stimuli to drive the DUT. During an emulation run, the hardware communicates with the software testbench using a high-speed link. For every DUT clock or for each time point in the model execution, communication may be required by one or more synthesizable transactors. In the general case, the DUT clocks will be suspended at times to complete all the communication requests for a given point in the model execution. So at any point of time, there could be inflight data in the link. Figure 1. Co-Modeling Architecture B. Review of DMTCP flow DMTCP is an open-source package that provides a capability for Checkpoint/Restart in applications involving multiple processes/threads distributed across multiple hosts and connected by socket connections. The package can be downloaded from: http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net It operates under Linux, with no modifications to the Linux kernel or to the user code, and it can be used by unprivileged users (no root privilege needed). One can later restart from a checkpoint, or even migrate the processes by moving the checkpoint files to another host prior to restarting. Figure 2 shows the typical flow of a user job under DMTCP. Figure 2. Typical flow of a user job under DMTCP A detailed description on DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) internals can be found in [1]. DMTCP also provides a flexible plugin model that supports the ability to write an add-on library that can: support DMTCP event hooks; add custom wrappers around system calls; and add a custom distributed name service facility [2, 3]. III. MOTIVATING USE CASES Checkpoint-restore of emulation jobs opens a wide of range of applications, which will help users build a fault- tolerant emulation system, powerful debug mechanisms, and increase usage efficiency of critical resources like hardware emulators. This section describes different use cases for such capability in emulation. The following section, Section IV, then presents the Checkpoint/Restore Framework in detail. A. Skipping repeated initial sequences Designs may have an initialization phase that is always executed for each test. This may be a hardware reset phase or boot-up, which takes a great deal of time before an actual test can start. We can save much of the emulation runtime by taking a checkpoint right after this repeated initial sequence. New tests can then just restart immediately after this initial sequence, thus saving a great deal of regression time. Another application of this is to do what-if analysis after reaching an interesting point in the execution. In Figure 3, each test Test0, Test1, Test2 executes the same initial sequence, which takes C1 time. Figure 3. Job Progress with fixed initialization sequence The tests then follow their own unique paths, completing the test in different time intervals (T0, T1, and T2). This C1 time is saved if we checkpoint just after completion of the initial sequence and then restore from the checkpoint at the original state in each test. B. Better Job Management Policies One of the advantages of virtualization of test environments is the ability to use emulators remotely. This allows emulation to be moved to the data center, with jobs being managed by a workload management platform such as LSF. However, the non-pre-emptive nature of emulation jobs forbids pre-emptive scheduling policies. This prevents a high-priority job from acquiring the resources occupied by a currently executing low-priority job. For example, a currently running long job cannot be removed even though a short job has just arrived. The short job has to wait until the long job exits and frees up the resources. Hence, the non-pre-emptive nature of emulation jobs can easily lead to inefficient use of emulators. Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 4: Figure 4. Job Management Job1 occupies 4 slots on Emulator1 and Job2 occupies 2 slots on Emulator2. Further a high-priority request from Job3 arrives for 6 resources. As resources are fragmented, irrespective of its priority, Job3 has to wait for either of Job1 or Job2 to finish. The Checkpoint/Restore capability can remove this shortcoming and enable a pre-emptive scheduling policy. We could have checkpointed either of Job1 or Job2 and freed up the resources for Job3. Whenever resources become available, the checkpointed job can then be restarted using the DMTCP restart scripts. Further, this situation also leads to inefficient use of emulators due to resource fragmentation within each emulator. Using Checkpoint/Restore we could have migrated an interfering job to a different emulator, thereby making contiguous resources available for the new job. In Figure 5, the checkpoint of Job2 is taken first, and then Job2 is restarted on Emulator1. This frees up all 6 slots on Emulator2 for Job3. Job3 can now be allocated using contiguous resources on Emulator2. Figure 5. Resource free with Job Migration Another interesting example concerns the issue of “fairness” for large-capacity jobs. In a distribution system dominated by high-priority, small-capacity jobs, a low-priority large-capacity job may never actually get a chance to run if the policy is to wait for required slots to become available. Further, a high-priority long job can lead to underutilization of emulation resources as freed slots cannot be allocated for other small jobs if they have to be pooled for a high-priority long job waiting in the queue. With checkpoint-restart, one can save all the small jobs at once, run the large job and then restart the small jobs. A long low-priority job might otherwise never get an opportunity to complete, if not for the use of checkpoint-restart. There are several such instances where checkpoint- restart can offer this kind of flexibility in an emulation job scheduling system. C. Debugging from past simulation time Debugging is an important requirement for verification engineers. Much time is spent in debugging functional issues in design as well as integration issues with software during validation of a full SoC. The ability to take a checkpoint of the full system can provide capabilities to start debugging just before an issue occurs, by restarting from the point of a previous checkpoint state. For example, one can take periodic checkpoints and when a problem is seen: start from the last checkpoint, run again and capture more debug information. This is a tremendous advantage when a debugging issue occurs only after a run of long duration. A large amount of time is saved, since one no longer needs to wait for the test to arrive at the point of interest. IV. CHECKPOINT/RESTORE FRAMEWORK In this section we describe the implementation of checkpoint-restore for emulation jobs. We address checkpoint and restore separately. Figure 6 shows the typical flow of an emulation job under DMTCP. Note that in Figure 2, the checkpoint was invoked by the user at an arbitrary point in time. However, in the emulation flow (Figure 6), the user invokes the checkpoint programmatically from within the user code, when the simulation reaches certain number of cycles. Figure 6. Typical flow of an emulation job under DMTCP. A. Checkpoint Checkpointing of emulation jobs involves both the emulator and the testbench on the workstation. One must save the simulation state for the design running on an emulator, while also employing binary-level checkpointing using DMTCP for the processes representing the testbench side and running on the workstation. As always, we have to make sure that the hardware side stops generating further transactions when a checkpoint is in progress. In addition, checkpointing requires that we make sure that there is no in-flight data inside the high-speed interface between the emulator and the testbench at the time of checkpointing. In the case that a checkpoint is taken without flushing the in-flight data, those transactions will be lost at the time of restoring from the checkpoint, thus resulting both in incorrect hardware state and incorrect state on the testbench side. Figure 7. Flowchart for Checkpoint Algorithm The following is the integrated algorithm for checkpointing of an emulation job. These steps are also depicted graphically in Figure 7. 1) A Checkpoint Request is received by the testbench either through an external utility such as dmtcp_command or through a user-exposed API, ScheduleCheckpoint, made by testbench itself. The request is sent to the emulator in order to freeze the running design. This will stop both the user design clocks and the simulation time itself. 2) Once a design is frozen, additional transactions from the hardware side will no longer be generated. At this point the data in flight inside the link is flushed until all of them have been processed and the emulator reaches a quiescent state. 3) When the emulator has reached a quiescent state, the system initiates the checkpoint of the emulator model by using the checkpoint technology native to the emulator. This will store the current design state to disk. 4) The system then disconnects from the emulator and makes sure that all emulator-related processes are terminated. This step will ensure that any external connections not running under DMTCP are removed from consideration. For example, there may be connections to a licensing server, to some waveform dump servers, and so on. This also reduces the overall checkpoint time by freeing up memory used by these external connections that the binary checkpointing procedure would otherwise have to save, as described in the next step. Further, checkpoints taken this way are independent of which specific emulator the session was running on, and this makes it easy to relocate saved emulation jobs to other emulators. 5) Next, the system initiates DMTCP-based checkpointing on the testbench side. This involves calling dmtcp_checkpoint, a part of the DMTCP API. Here, one writes an emulation-specific external plugin for DMTCP, which will specify which files must be checkpointed. The DMTCP plugin is specific to the emulator and testbench infrastructure, and must also specify the path to the checkpoint database, where DMTCP checkpoint image files are saved alongside the hardware database, as a consolidated database within the user specified path. . DMTCP also allows a user to have certain processes be explicitly excluded from checkpointing. This might be required for the case where processes have been spawned from an external library linked into the user testbench. Those processes are not required as part of a correct checkpoint state. And further, attempting to save such superfluous processes leads to other issues when restoring from a checkpoint if those processes were communicating with external processes that were not running under DMTCP. The details of DMTCP external plugins can be found in [2, 3]. 6) After the invocation of dmtcp_checkpoint returns, we can choose either to exit the current emulation or to resume the current run. 7) After resuming from a checkpoint, the following steps are taken: ● Re-connect to same emulator and configure the same design again. ● Restart the tool-specific processes and re-connect to servers from which they exited in step (4). This step is isolated to the emulation tool’s internal workings, and does not require the collaboration of DMTCP. ● Perform a hardware design restore from the same checkpoint database and start the design clocks. ● Note that after being restored from a checkpoint, the testbench side resumes in a correct state at the end of this procedure, and so nothing more is required on the testbench side. B. Restore/Restart The DMTCP package dumps a restart script at the time of checkpoint. This script takes care of restarting the entire testbench tree of processes. This script also takes care of restarting processes that were on remote machines. After restart, the system will “wake up” in step (6) in the checkpoint sequence above, as if we have just returned from the call to dmtcp_checkpoint. So the remaining steps to restart are the same as those described in step (7) above. Figure 8. Flowchart for Restore The following is the algorithm for the restart/resume. These steps are also depicted graphically in Figure 8. 1) Use the restart script generated by DMTCP that relies on the checkpoint database (the checkpoint image files) in order to bring the whole testbench tree of processes up and running. 2) After DMTCP’s restore/restart, we return from the call to dmtcp_checkpoint. The next steps bring the HDL side up and fork any tool-specific processes. 3) The system then re-connects the emulator resource and downloads the design. 4) The system then restarts the tool-specific processes and re-connects to external servers such as license servers, waveform collection servers, etc. This step is completely isolated from the internal workings of the emulator tool. 5) The system then performs the hardware design restore using the same checkpoint database, and it starts the design clocks. This is the last step in successfully restoring the emulation. V. CASE STUDY: SKIPPING THE OS BOOT IN AN OEM COMPANY’S SOC VALIDATION ENVIRONMENT For this case study, the SoC validation environment instantiates a SoC containing a CPU, Memory Subsystem, Switching Fabric, and peripherals. The SoC is modeled in a hybrid environment whereby part of the SoC is modeled on the workstation and part of the SoC is modeled in the emulator, and the Switching Fabric is the bridge between the models. Many of the SoC validation use cases require firstly booting an operating system (OS) in order to run the applications that are being validated. The boot of the OS takes on the order of hours to days. Often the applications that are being validated execute in a fraction of the time that it takes to boot the OS. This means that only a fraction of the emulation time was used to validate the application and the larger portion of the time is spent booting the OS in order to be able to run the application. Thus the overall boot time has an important impact not only on how many applications can be run per user per day, but also, from an emulation efficiency standpoint, how much emulation time is spent just getting the OS booted versus running the applications that are used to validate the SoC and/or the application. The ideal scenario would be to eliminate the time it takes to boot the OS. A solution close to the ideal scenario is to checkpoint the SoC validation environment after the boot of the OS. This OS boot can then be delivered as part of a checkpoint image that is bundled with the rest of the SoC validation environment. The checkpoint of the hardware can be taken by technology native to the emulator. The complexity is in the checkpointing of the part of the SoC validation environment that is executing on the workstation. There were two early attempts to checkpoint, before settling on DMTCP as the preferred solution. A first attempt at checkpointing, prior to the use of DMTCP, was to capture all of the stimulus from the hardware during the OS boot along with a checkpoint of the hardware, and then to restore the OS boot using the stimulus. This stimulus was replayed into the software test bench to re-establish the state of the software, and then finally restore the state of the emulator using the hardware checkpoint. This method worked, except it had two notable drawbacks: (1) Depending on how much stimulus needed to be captured, the size of the replay database could become quite large. (2) The time it took the software testbench to execute, controlled the time it took to perform the restoration of the software testbench. A second attempt at checkpointing prior to employing DMTCP was to leverage the Boost C++ libraries to make each of the software components of the SoC validation environment checkpoint-able. This method worked except that it had a major drawback in that each SoC validation software component had to be developed with checkpointing in mind and if there was just one component that didn¹t support checkpointing or did the checkpointing incorrectly, the SoC validation environment was not checkpoint-able. Hence, the ideal solution would be to transparently checkpoint the software in the same way as we checkpoint the hardware. The DMTCP-based approach was able to overcome the limitations of these first two attempts by transparently checkpointing the software on the workstation, which includes the part of the SoC modeled on the workstation, the software testbench, and the emulation software. The checkpoint is taken without concern for how the software has been modeled and also without concern for the speed at which the software testbench executes. This resulted in making an “OS boot” checkpoint available to the users along with the SoC verification environment. This allows those users to restore the checkpoint in less than 5 minutes, and to then to run their applications for SoC validation in an environment after the OS boot. Now, users requiring this use case can focus their emulation time on running their application, and skipping the lengthy OS boot time. The DMTCP-based approach has accelerated the time to run an application by close to a factor of two. Additionally, it has freed up the emulation time that would have been spent in “OS boot”, thus saving many hours of emulation time. In addition, the DMTCP approach also saves the state of the emulation runtime software itself. This feature provides added value, as compared to the two earlier checkpointing approaches. The checkpoint-restore flow can now set up to address additional aspects of the emulation runtime environment, such as triggers, which are important for debugging in the case of an exception. This enables the designer to create an environment closer to a “turnkey solution”, in which the end user no longer has to remember to load the trigger prior to starting the run of their application. First use case of DMTCP at an OEM company was on a regression suite consisting of 40 jobs. The 40 jobs had a similar profile in that they required around 1 hour to boot the OS and then 1 hour of execution of test content. DMTCP was used to create a checkpoint just after the boot of the OS. This checkpoint then becomes part of the collateral of that database. Any future user of that database and software configuration can restore the checkpoint rather than re-running the boot of the OS. The restoration of database using the checkpoint takes around 5 minutes. That is a time savings of 55 minutes per job for this regression. As a reminder, this environment is a hybrid environment and pending the configuration of whether the CPU is in software or RTL and also the type of OS can greatly impact the ""OS boot"" time from an hour to days. For this regression the 40 jobs were able to run in around 22 hours versus previously they would have taken 40 hour. Job throughput was increased close to 2x. This results not only in a substantial time savings but also a substantial cost savings. Figure 9. Regression Suite Emulation Time Comparison Figure 9 is highlighting the changes introduced by adding DMTCP into this use case; the following points are related to the numbers in the figure 9. 1) Checkpoint is created for OS boot as part of preparing the database for users. 2) Restoring OS boot from checkpoint saves 55 minutes for each job. 3) First job is completed after 1.1 hours with DMTCP versus 2 hours without DMTCP. 4) Full regression is completed after 22.9 hours with DMTCP versus 40 hours without DMTCP. During the integration of DMTCP with the emulation and SoC validation environment, we faced several challenges: (1) Very large read-only files were being saved as part of the checkpoint. This had an impact on both checkpoint/restore time as well as the memory footprint on disk. This was solved by having the DMTCP Emulation plugin detect and decide not to checkpoint such read-only files. The tool-specific file list was written into the DMTCP plugin to identify just those files that needed to be checkpointed. (2) Checkpoints were not portable to another site, due to some file paths that were preserved as part of the checkpoint. This was solved by using the existing file path virtualization plugin of DMTCP, allowing these paths to be changed at restore time. Limitations found when deploying DMTCP 1) Some use cases have a remote process connected via TCP on Windows machine. Additional work would be required to support this kind of use case both within the DMTCP community as well as in the testbench infrastructure. 2) Some use cases require changing the initial state of the environment which is part of the DMTCP checkpoint. For instance, if you had a SoC that had a programmable number of DIMMs and the number of DIMMs was changing per test you wouldn't be able to re-use a single checkpoint. DMTCP was found to be easy to integrate, and it required minimal changes to emulation environment. This has demonstrated the success of this approach toward OS-based use case validation during emulation. VI. FUTURE WORK We intend to work on developing preemptive capabilities for emulation jobs in a workload management system such as LSF. A case study in this environment is needed in order to discover the practical challenges thereof, and to help deploy this technology for more flexible job scheduling management. Finally, verification of a network switch presents an additional interesting case study for the future. In this scenario, a virtual machine is often required, so that simulated Ethernet traffic can be injected by the virtual machine into the environment for verification test coverage. This makes transparent checkpointing on the testbench side more difficult, since even though the virtual machine can be modified to inject Ethernet traffic, the virtual machine snapshot facility is difficult to modify, and so the state of the Ethernet traffic generator will not be checkpointed. On restore, some steps in the state diagram for Ethernet packets may be lost. As part of future work, it is proposed to use the ability of DMTCP to checkpoint a virtual machine from the outside. DMTCP has the ability to carry out a snapshot from the outside for the case of a QEMU virtual machine over KVM [4]. That same work [4] also presents DMTCP's ability to checkpoint a network of virtual machines. This latter case makes possible verification for end-to-end Ethernet test coverage between two virtual machines. VII. CONCLUSION This paper describes the approach to transparently checkpoint/restore emulation jobs and various key benefits it brings along with it. This integration was successfully tried in an OEM company’s SOC validation environment, which not only reduced total regression time but also increased Emulator efficiency. Emulation time is precious and any saving of this time directly affects one’s total verification cost. Experimental results have shown that this approach, when integrated with job management system, has increased the emulator utilization and has also increased the productivity of the verification engineers by providing them with a window to look back in time. The integration has also been successfully tried for a variety of software testbenches including C/C++/SystemC, and a SystemVerilog testbench running on a simulator. These testbenches can have multiple threads or multiple processes spread across different machines.",1850

To address these issues, we introduce FusionFlow, a system that cooperatively utilizes both CPUs and GPUs to accelerate the data preprocessing stage of DL training that runs the data augmentation algorithm. FusionFlow orchestrates data preprocessing tasks across CPUs and GPUs while minimizing interference with GPU-based model training. In doing so, it effectively mitigates the risk of GPU memory overflow by managing memory allocations of the tasks within the GPU-wide free space. Furthermore, FusionFlow provides a dynamic scheduling strategy for tasks with varying computational demands and reallocates compute resources on the fly to enhance training throughput for both single and multi-GPU DL jobs.

The key idea is exploiting intra-batch parallelism, which splits an input mini-batch into mul- tiple tiny-batches and augments the mini-batch in parallel on those compute resources. FusionFlow applies several optimizations to make GPU-offloading of tiny-batch tasks highly effective and per- forms CPU worker scaling to make CPU resource usage in data- parallel training more balanced.

In this paper, we present a modular constructive approach to generate levels in a puzzle programming game. The approach uses a grammar to gen- erate game elements from code and works backwards from the solution to ensure solvability, controllability over the so- lution, and variation, allowing for alternative solutions that preserve the learning goals.In this paper, we presented a grammar based modular ap- proach to generate levels in a programming puzzle game. The approach works backwards from a solution code and uses both the solution map and the initial map to ensure that levels are solvable using the input code. The levels gener- ated allow variation in the solution space through alterna- tive codes while minimizing shorter, more trivial solutions. However, some of them still allow shorter codes. In the fu- ture, we want to improve on the approach, build a user- friendly interface and conduct a user-study with designers. Further, we would like to work on integrating procedurally generated levels within the game according to some player model that will inform us about the coding constructs that the player needs practice with.",1854

Improving Deep Policy Gradients with Value Function Search ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6qZC7pfenQm","Deep Policy Gradient (PG) algorithms employ value networks to drive the learn- ing of parameterized policies and reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. However, value function approximation gets stuck in local optima and struggles to fit the actual return, limiting the variance reduction efficacy and leading policies to sub-optimal performance. This paper focuses on improving value approxima- tion and analyzing the effects on Deep PG primitives such as value prediction, variance reduction, and correlation of gradient estimates with the true gradient. To this end, we introduce a Value Function Search that employs a population of perturbed value networks to search for a better approximation. Our framework does not require additional environment interactions, gradient computations, or ensembles, providing a computationally inexpensive approach to enhance the su- pervised learning task on which value networks train. Crucially, we show that improving Deep PG primitives results in improved sample efficiency and policies with higher returns using common continuous control benchmark domains. 1VFS introduces a two-scale perturbation operator voted to diversify a population of value networks to (i) explore local variations of current critics’ predictions and (ii) allow to explore diversified value functions to escape from local optima. The practical results of such components have been investigated with additional experiments that also motivate the improvement in sample efficiency and performance of VFS-based algorithms in a range of standard continuous control benchmarks. Our findings suggest that improving fundamental Deep PG primitives translates into higher-performing policies and better sample efficiency. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 7",1855

How.

The practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is limited to only small-scale synchronous decision-making scenarios or a single agent planning its best response against a single adversary with ﬁxed, procedurally characterized strategies. In contrast this paper considers a more realistic class of problems where a team of asynchronous agents with limited observation and communication capabilities need to compete against multiple strategic adversaries with changing strategies. This problem necessitates agents that can coordinate to detect changes in adversary strategies and plan the best response accordingly. Our approach ﬁrst optimizes a set of stratagems that represent these best responses. These optimized stratagems are then inte- grated into a uniﬁed policy that can detect and respond when the adversaries change their strategies. The near-optimality of the proposed framework is established theoretically as well as demonstrated empirically in simulation and hardware.This paper introduces a novel near-optimal adversarial pol- icy switching algorithm for decentralized, non-cooperative multi-agent systems. Unlike the existing works in literature which are mostly limited to simple decision-making sce- narios where a single agent plans its best response against an adversary whose strategy is speciﬁed a priori under reasonable assumptions, we investigate instead a class of multi-agent scenarios where multiple robots need to operate independently in collaboration with their teammates to act effectively against adversaries with changing strategies. To achieve this, we ﬁrst optimize a set of basic stratagems that each is tuned to respond optimally to a pre-identiﬁed basic tactic of the adversaries. The stratagems are then integrated into a uniﬁed policy which performs near-optimally against B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 (a) (b) (c) B3 B2 B1 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 (d) (e) (f) Fig. 6: Image excerpts from a video demo showing (1) a team of 3 allied (blue) robots (B1,B2 and B3) that implement the optimized stratagem produced by our framework (Section III) to compete against (2) an opposing team of 2 opponent (red) robots (R1 and R2) which implement the hand-coded tactics DL and DR (see Section VI-A), respectively: (a) B1,B2 and B3 decide to invade the opposition territory; (b) B1 and B3 decide to attack the center while B2 decides to take the left ﬂank of the opposition; (c) B2 passes through R1’s defense while B1 takes an interesting position to block R2 so that B3 can pass through its defense; (d) B1 and B2 detect the ﬂag and mount a pincer attack; (e) R2 arrives to defend the ﬂag and B2 retreats to avoid getting tagged; and (f) without noticing B1 from behind, R2 continues its DR patrol, thus losing the ﬂag to B1. any high-level strategies of the adversaries that switches between their basic tactics. The near-optimality of our pro- posed framework can be established in both theoretical and empirical settings with interesting and consistent results. We believe this is a signiﬁcant step towards bridging the gap between theory and practice in multi-agent research.",1856

In the Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-17), August 2017","The decentralized partially observable Markov de- cision process (Dec-POMDP) is a powerful model for representing multi-agent problems with de- centralized behavior. Unfortunately, current Dec- POMDP solution methods cannot solve problems with continuous observations, which are common in many real-world domains. To that end, we present a framework for representing and gener- ating Dec-POMDP policies that explicitly include continuous observations. We apply our algorithm to a novel tagging problem and an extended version of a common benchmark, where it generates poli- cies that meet or exceed the values of equivalent discretized domains without the need for ﬁnding an adequate discretization. 1This paper presented, for the ﬁrst time, an algorithm that gen- erates joint policies for Dec-POMDPs with continuous ob- servations. We presented both a discrete-observation ver- sion of the algorithm, which is applicable in domains with a large number of discrete observations, and a continuous- observation version. This method is broadly applicable as many real-world domains have large or continuous observa- tion spaces. COG-DICE has been successful in generating joint policies for both a novel and a preexisting problem and has highlighted the negative impacts that inappropriate dis- cretization can have on joint policy structure and value.

Emergent World Representations: Exploring a Sequence Model Trained on a Synthetic Task ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DeG07_TcZvT","Language models show a surprising range of capabilities, but the source of their apparent competence is unclear. Do these networks just memorize a collection of surface statistics, or do they rely on internal representations of the process that generates the sequences they see? We investigate this question in a synthetic setting by applying a variant of the GPT model to the task of predicting legal moves in a simple board game, Othello. Although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules, we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state. Interventional experiments indicate this representation can be used to control the output of the network. By leveraging these intervention techniques, we produce “latent saliency maps” that help explain predictions. 1 1Our experiments provide evidence that Othello-GPT maintains a representation of game board states— that is, the Othello “world”—to produce sequences it was trained on. This representation appears to be nonlinear in an essential way. Further, we find that these representations can be causally linked to how the model makes its predictions. Understanding of the internal representations of a sequence model is interesting in its own right, but may also be helpful in deeper interpretations of the network. We have also described how interventional experiments may be used to create a “latent saliency map”, which gives a picture, in terms of the Othello board, of how the network has made a prediction. Applied to two versions of Othello-GPT that were trained on different data sets, the latent saliency maps highlight the dramatic differences between underlying representations of the Othello-GPT trained on synthetic dataset and its counterpart trained on championship dataset. There are several potential lines of future work. One natural extension would be to perform the same type of investigations with other, more complex games. It would also be interesting to compare the strategies learned by a sequence model trained on game transcripts with those of a model trained with a priori knowledge of Othello. One option is to compare latent saliency maps of Othello–GPT with standard saliency maps of an Othello-playing program which has the actual board state as input. More broadly, it would be interesting to study how our results generalize to models trained on natural language. One stepping stone might be to look at language models whose training data has included game transcripts. Will we see similar representation of board state? Grammar engineering tools (Weston et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2017; Cˆot´e et al., 2018) could help define a synthetic data generation process that maps world representations onto natural language sentences, providing a similarly controllable setting like Othello while closing the distance to natural languages. For more complex natural language tasks, can we find meaningful world representations? Our hope is that the tools described in this paper—nonlinear probes, layerwise interventions, and latent saliency maps—may prove useful in natural language settings. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023",1858

Exploring the Indian Political YouTube Landscape: A Multimodal Multi-Task Approach MUWS@CIKM, 3-17. https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3566/paper1.pdf","Social media profoundly influences all facets of our lives, including politics. Political parties, politicians, and media outlets have strategically cultivated their social media presence to engage with the public. However, with the advent of freely available Internet services in India, there has been a rising proliferation in the community of independent content creators on YouTube, with many getting millions of views per video. In this study, we present a novel multimodal dataset of videos, taken from 20 independent and influential content creators, annotated for five socially and politically relevant labels with a high inter-annotator score (0.820 - 0.956 Cohen’s Kappa Score) falling under the categories - Humour/Satire, Opposition/Criticism, Support/Advocacy, and Informational/Analysis. We consider three modalities in our dataset - textual (title and description of the video), visual (thumbnail) and audio (MFCC coefficients and additional spectral and temporal features) modalities. We also perform preliminary classification on our dataset using an early fusion multimodal model, combining audio, visual and textual modalities, which performs better than other unimodal and bimodal approaches, yielding a Macro-F1 score of 0.8742 and ROC-AUC score of 0.769. By introducing this novel dataset, we aim to stimulate further investigation within the domains of opinion dissemination across social networks and the analysis of multimodal content, especially within the Indian context. Keywords Multimodal Analysis, Political Analysis, Social Media Analysiss The consumption of content on social media sites, like YouTube, has grown manifold over the last decade. This has led to an exponential rise in the creation of short-form and long-form content on various topics, ranging from comedic videos to documentaries. In this study, we analyzed one such content creation topic, political videos uploaded by independent Indian content creators. We annotated around 400 videos collected from YouTube for different socially and politically relevant labels. We performed a content analysis on our annotated dataset using BERTopic for topic modelling and YAKE! for keyword extraction. We also applied an early fusion multimodal model on the features extracted using state-of-the-art backbone representations, namely MuRIL for text, ConvNeXT for images, and MCFF, ZCR, Spectral Bandwidth, Chroma STFT and Spectral Rolloff for audio. Our classification model yielded a Macro-F1 score of 0.8742. Compared to other unimodal and bimodal models, the early fusion model yielded significantly better results. 6. Future Work Future work that focuses on a number of important areas of development will raise the calibre and scope of this research. Here are some directions we want to go in: 1. Experimentation with other fusion models In this paper, we used an early fusion model, combining modalities before classification. However, there are alternative fusion techniques that warrant exploration, such as late fusion models, where each modality is processed independently before being integrated with other modalities, and attention- based fusion models where the importance of different modalities is assessed with respect to the task at hand, or ensemble models, which combines the strengths of multiple prediction models to improve results. 2. Audio feature extraction The features extracted for audio in this study are numerical metrics that regrettably fail to capture the nuances of speech, especially code-mixed Hindi-English speech, which is a predominant mode of communication in India. Experi- menting with other audio feature extraction methods, for example, using transcripts to capture semantic meaning, Mel-frequency spectrograms to capture phonetic variation or transformer-based models that are distinguished for their contextual understanding can offer more sophisticated results. 3. Extending the dataset We chose to annotate data collected for five tasks for the purposes of this study. However, the methods of classification and analysis can be extended to include even more relevant labels that cover more NLP and discourse analysis tasks. This includes the detection of hate speech towards marginalised communities veiled as opinions, misinformation and fake news detection or the spread and polarization of public opinions over time. 4. Multilingual and cross-regional support While our selection procedure primarily focused on YouTube channels that offered content in Hindi or English, it’s important to recognise that a more inclusive approach is necessary for a thorough representation of India’s political environment. To adequately capture the complex and varied political narratives that arise across the nation’s various linguistic and cultural realms, region- specific content must be included.",1859

However, this openness and features of anonymity have also given rise to the proliferation of harmful and offensive content, including sexism. This research aims at proposing a methodology and explores the use of different simple transformers. Monolingual Simple Transformers such as BERT, RoBERTa[1], BERTweet, DistilBERT, XLNet were evaluated on the EXIST2023 shared task challenge at the IberLEF2023 dataset. It was observed that RoBERTa has given the best results among all other transformers. The proposed approach has great scope for the efficient detection of sexist content on social media, aiding in the development of effective content moderation systems. Keywords Sexism Detection, Simple Transformer Models, Natural Language Processing,, our study highlights the effectiveness of pre-trained transformer models in detecting sexism in tweets, both in English and Spanish. The results demonstrate the importance of using language-specific models and models designed for social media data to achieve higher accuracy. This research contributes to the development of automated systems for identifying and addressing sexism in online communication, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and respectful digital environment. 6. Conclusion In this research, we investigated the detection of sexism in tweets using pre-trained transformer models for both English and Spanish languages. Our results demonstrate that these models can be effective in identifying instances of sexism in social media content. The BERTweet model performed well in capturing the nuances of English tweets, while the CamemBERT model showed promise for Spanish tweets. Additionally, the XLNet model exhibited superior performance among the English models, highlighting the effectiveness of permutation-based approaches. However, it is important to note that the accuracies achieved, especially for Spanish models, can still be improved. The findings of this study have implications for developing automated systems that can detect and mitigate sexism in online communication. By leveraging pre-trained transformer models, we can gain insights into the prevalence of sexism and take steps toward fostering a more inclusive and respectful digital environment. 7. Future Work While this research provides valuable insights into the detection of sexism in tweets, there are several avenues for future work that can enhance the accuracy and robustness of the models. Firstly, data augmentation techniques can be employed to improve model performance [3] [4] [5] [6]. By increasing the diversity and quantity of training data through techniques such as back-translation, word replacement, or text synthesis, we can potentially reduce the model’s bias and enhance its ability to detect subtle forms of sexism. Secondly, ensemble modeling can be explored to leverage the strengths of multiple models and improve overall performance. By combining predictions from different models, either by majority voting or weighted averaging, we can potentially achieve higher accuracy and mitigate the limitations of individual models. Furthermore, it is important to expand the evaluation of sexism detection models to different languages and cultural contexts. The linguistic characteristics and contextual nuances can significantly vary across languages, necessitating the development of language-specific models and datasets. Additionally, further research should focus on addressing the issue of bias in the models. It is crucial to identify and mitigate any biases encoded in the pre-trained models to ensure fair and equitable detection of sexism. Finally, it would be beneficial to conduct user studies and assess the real-world impact of automated systems in addressing sexism in online spaces. Understanding user perceptions, reactions, and potential ethical concerns will guide the development of more effective and responsible solutions. By pursuing these avenues, we can advance the field of sexism detection in social media and contribute to the development of robust and inclusive technologies.",1860

Sequential data, including time-series and ordered data, contain important structural relation- ships among items, imposed by underlying dynamic models of data, that should play a vital role in the selection of representatives. However, nearly all existing subset selection techniques ignore underlying dynamics of data and treat items independently, leading to incompatible sets of representatives. In this paper, we develop a new framework for sequential subset selection that ﬁnds a set of represen- tatives compatible with the dynamic models of data. To do so, we equip items with transition dynamic models and pose the problem as an integer binary optimization over assignments of sequential items to representatives, that leads to high encoding, diversity and transition potentials. Our formulation generalizes the well-known facility location objective to deal with sequential data, incorporating transition dynamics among facilities. As the proposed formulation is non-convex, we derive a max-sum message passing algorithm to solve the problem efﬁciently.

Emergent World Representations: Exploring a Sequence Model Trained on a Synthetic Task ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=DeG07_TcZvT","Language models show a surprising range of capabilities, but the source of their apparent competence is unclear. Do these networks just memorize a collection of surface statistics, or do they rely on internal representations of the process that generates the sequences they see? We investigate this question in a synthetic setting by applying a variant of the GPT model to the task of predicting legal moves in a simple board game, Othello. Although the network has no a priori knowledge of the game or its rules, we uncover evidence of an emergent nonlinear internal representation of the board state. Interventional experiments indicate this representation can be used to control the output of the network. By leveraging these intervention techniques, we produce “latent saliency maps” that help explain predictions. 1 1Our experiments provide evidence that Othello-GPT maintains a representation of game board states— that is, the Othello “world”—to produce sequences it was trained on. This representation appears to be nonlinear in an essential way. Further, we find that these representations can be causally linked to how the model makes its predictions. Understanding of the internal representations of a sequence model is interesting in its own right, but may also be helpful in deeper interpretations of the network. We have also described how interventional experiments may be used to create a “latent saliency map”, which gives a picture, in terms of the Othello board, of how the network has made a prediction. Applied to two versions of Othello-GPT that were trained on different data sets, the latent saliency maps highlight the dramatic differences between underlying representations of the Othello-GPT trained on synthetic dataset and its counterpart trained on championship dataset. There are several potential lines of future work. One natural extension would be to perform the same type of investigations with other, more complex games. It would also be interesting to compare the strategies learned by a sequence model trained on game transcripts with those of a model trained with a priori knowledge of Othello. One option is to compare latent saliency maps of Othello–GPT with standard saliency maps of an Othello-playing program which has the actual board state as input. More broadly, it would be interesting to study how our results generalize to models trained on natural language. One stepping stone might be to look at language models whose training data has included game transcripts. Will we see similar representation of board state? Grammar engineering tools (Weston et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2017; Cˆot´e et al., 2018) could help define a synthetic data generation process that maps world representations onto natural language sentences, providing a similarly controllable setting like Othello while closing the distance to natural languages. For more complex natural language tasks, can we find meaningful world representations? Our hope is that the tools described in this paper—nonlinear probes, layerwise interventions, and latent saliency maps—may prove useful in natural language settings. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023",1870

We described our complete pipeline to apply our ap- proach to two different topologies: the 3D Network and the Ghirigoro. The results obtained by employing our method- ology are novel and inspirational. We compared the out- puts of the pipeline while using or not the 3D-cGAN and found that using the Vox2Vox output as a prior distribution results in much nicer outcomes where features are placed in strategic positions in the 3D shape preserving its struc- tural features. As a future direction, we plan to improve the 3D-to-3D topology transfer by given also the topology as a conditional input of the generative network.

Improving Deep Policy Gradients with Value Function Search ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6qZC7pfenQm","Deep Policy Gradient (PG) algorithms employ value networks to drive the learn- ing of parameterized policies and reduce the variance of the gradient estimates. However, value function approximation gets stuck in local optima and struggles to fit the actual return, limiting the variance reduction efficacy and leading policies to sub-optimal performance. This paper focuses on improving value approxima- tion and analyzing the effects on Deep PG primitives such as value prediction, variance reduction, and correlation of gradient estimates with the true gradient. To this end, we introduce a Value Function Search that employs a population of perturbed value networks to search for a better approximation. Our framework does not require additional environment interactions, gradient computations, or ensembles, providing a computationally inexpensive approach to enhance the su- pervised learning task on which value networks train. Crucially, we show that improving Deep PG primitives results in improved sample efficiency and policies with higher returns using common continuous control benchmark domains. 1VFS introduces a two-scale perturbation operator voted to diversify a population of value networks to (i) explore local variations of current critics’ predictions and (ii) allow to explore diversified value functions to escape from local optima. The practical results of such components have been investigated with additional experiments that also motivate the improvement in sample efficiency and performance of VFS-based algorithms in a range of standard continuous control benchmarks. Our findings suggest that improving fundamental Deep PG primitives translates into higher-performing policies and better sample efficiency. 9 Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 7",1876

The practicality of existing works addressing this challenge is limited to only small-scale synchronous decision-making scenarios or a single agent planning its best response against a single adversary with ﬁxed, procedurally characterized strategies. In contrast this paper considers a more realistic class of problems where a team of asynchronous agents with limited observation and communication capabilities need to compete against multiple strategic adversaries with changing strategies. This problem necessitates agents that can coordinate to detect changes in adversary strategies and plan the best response accordingly. Our approach ﬁrst optimizes a set of stratagems that represent these best responses. These optimized stratagems are then inte- grated into a uniﬁed policy that can detect and respond when the adversaries change their strategies. The near-optimality of the proposed framework is established theoretically as well as demonstrated empirically in simulation and hardware.This paper introduces a novel near-optimal adversarial pol- icy switching algorithm for decentralized, non-cooperative multi-agent systems. Unlike the existing works in literature which are mostly limited to simple decision-making sce- narios where a single agent plans its best response against an adversary whose strategy is speciﬁed a priori under reasonable assumptions, we investigate instead a class of multi-agent scenarios where multiple robots need to operate independently in collaboration with their teammates to act effectively against adversaries with changing strategies. To achieve this, we ﬁrst optimize a set of basic stratagems that each is tuned to respond optimally to a pre-identiﬁed basic tactic of the adversaries. The stratagems are then integrated into a uniﬁed policy which performs near-optimally against B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 (a) (b) (c) B3 B2 B1 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 B1 B3 B2 R1 R2 (d) (e) (f) Fig. 6: Image excerpts from a video demo showing (1) a team of 3 allied (blue) robots (B1,B2 and B3) that implement the optimized stratagem produced by our framework (Section III) to compete against (2) an opposing team of 2 opponent (red) robots (R1 and R2) which implement the hand-coded tactics DL and DR (see Section VI-A), respectively: (a) B1,B2 and B3 decide to invade the opposition territory; (b) B1 and B3 decide to attack the center while B2 decides to take the left ﬂank of the opposition; (c) B2 passes through R1’s defense while B1 takes an interesting position to block R2 so that B3 can pass through its defense; (d) B1 and B2 detect the ﬂag and mount a pincer attack; (e) R2 arrives to defend the ﬂag and B2 retreats to avoid getting tagged; and (f) without noticing B1 from behind, R2 continues its DR patrol, thus losing the ﬂag to B1. any high-level strategies of the adversaries that switches between their basic tactics. The near-optimality of our pro- posed framework can be established in both theoretical and empirical settings with interesting and consistent results.

Integrating Symmetry into Differentiable Planning with Steerable Convolutions ICLR. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=n7CPzMPKQl","In this paper, we study a principled approach on incorporating group symme- try into end-to-end differentiable planning algorithms and explore the benefits of symmetry in planning. To achieve this, we draw inspiration from equivariant con- volution networks and model the path planning problem as a set of signals over grids. We demonstrate that value iteration can be treated as a linear equivariant op- erator, which is effectively a steerable convolution. Building upon Value Iteration Networks (VIN), we propose a new Symmetric Planning (SymPlan) framework that incorporates rotation and reflection symmetry using steerable convolution networks. We evaluate our approach on four tasks: 2D navigation, visual navi- gation, 2 degrees of freedom (2-DOF) configuration space manipulation, and 2- DOF workspace manipulation. Our experimental results show that our symmetric planning algorithms significantly improve training efficiency and generalization performance compared to non-equivariant baselines, including VINs and GPPN. 1, SymVIN and SymGPPN generalize better to different map sizes, com- pared to all non-equivariant baselines. Remark. In summary, our results show that the Sym- Plan models demonstrate end-to-end planning and learn- ing ability, potentially enabling further applications to other tasks as a differentiable component for planning. Additional results and ablation studies are in Appendix H. 7 DISCUSSION In this work, we study the symmetry in the 2D path-planning problem, and build a framework using the theory of steerable CNNs to prove that value iteration in path planning is actually a form of steer- able CNN (on 2D grids).

The relation C Aτ −→C′ specifies that executing the next instruction may result in the configuration C′. The action Aτ indicates whether this reduction is observable: it is either the silent action, written τ, an I/O action read lit or print lit, or stop. We write C T −→∗C′ when there are zero or more steps from C to C′. The trace T is a list of non-silent actions in the order in which they appeared. Actions are defined in Figure 16, and the full reduction relation is given in Figure 17.

This is a technical device to ensure that the resulting configuration is stuck. A program with a silent loop has a different trace from a program that halts.

The idea is to define, for each program transformation, a correspondence relation R between configurations over the source and transformed programs. We show that related configurations have the same observable behavior, and reducing them results in configurations that are themselves related. Two programs are equivalent if their starting configurations are related. Definition 5.1 (Weak Bisimulation). Given programs P1 and P2 and relation R between the config- urations of P1 and P2, R is a weak simulation if for any related states (C1, C2) ∈R and any reduction C1 Aτ −→C′ 1 over P1, there exists a reduction C2 Aτ −→∗C′ 2 over P2 such that (C′ 1, C′ 2) are themselves related by R. Reduction over P2 is allowed to take zero or more steps, but not to change the trace. In other words, the diagram on the left below can always be completed into the diagram on the right. C1 C′ 1 C2 R Aτ C1 C′ 1 C2 C′ 2 R Aτ R ∗ Aτ R is a weak bisimulation if it is a weak simulation and the symmetric relation R−1 also is—a reduction from C2 can be matched by CS Speculative optimizations are key to just-in-time optimization of dynamic languages. As these optimizations depend on predicates about the program state, the language implementation must monitor the validity of predicates and be ready to deoptimize the program if a predicate is invalidated. While, many modern compiler rely on this approach, the interplay between optimization and deoptimization often remains opaque. Our contribution is to show that when the predicates and the deoptimization metadata are reified in the program representation, it becomes quite easy to define correct program transformations that are deoptimization aware. In this work we extend the intermediate representation with one new instruction, assume, which plays the double role of checking for the validity of predicates and specifying the actions required to deoptimize the program. Program transformations can inspect both the predicates that are being monitored and the deoptimization metadata and transform them when needed. The formalization presented here is for one particular intermediate language that we hope to be representative of a typical dynamic language. We present a bisimulation proof between multiple versions of the same function, optimized under different assumptions. We formalize deoptimization invariants between versions and show that they enable very simple proofs for standard compiler optimizations, constant folding, unreachable code elimination, and function inlining. We also prove correct three optimizations that are specifically dealing with deoptimizations, namely unrestricted deoptimization, predicate hoisting, and assume composition. There are multiple avenues of future investigation. The optimizations presented here rely on intraprocedural analysis and the granularity of deoptimization is a whole function. If we were to extend this work to interprocedural analysis, it would become much trickier to determine what functions are to be invalidated as a speculation in one function may allow optimizations in many other functions. The current representation forces to check predicates before each use, but some predicates are cheaper to check by monitoring operations that could invalidate them. To do this would require changes to our model as the assume instruction would need to be split between a monitor and a deoptimization point. Lastly, the expressive power of predicates is an interesting question as there is a clear trade-off — richer predicates may allow more optimizations but are likely to be costlier to monitor.",1882

Symp. on High Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing, Phoenix, AZ, USA, ACM, pp. 49--60, June, 2019","Transparently checkpointing MPI for fault tolerance and load bal- ancing is a long-standing problem in HPC. The problem has been complicated by the need to provide checkpoint-restart services for all combinations of an MPI implementation over all network interconnects. This work presents MANA (MPI-Agnostic Network- Agnostic transparent checkpointing), a single code base which sup- ports all MPI implementation and interconnect combinations. The agnostic properties imply that one can checkpoint an MPI appli- cation under one MPI implementation and perhaps over TCP, and then restart under a second MPI implementation over InfiniBand on a cluster with a different number of CPU cores per node. This tech- nique is based on a novel split-process approach, which enables two separate programs to co-exist within a single process with a single address space. This work overcomes the limitations of the two most widely adopted transparent checkpointing solutions, BLCR and DMTCP/InfiniBand, which require separate modifications to each MPI implementation and/or underlying network AP2 MANA: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION Multiple aspects of the design of MANA are covered in this sec- tion. Section 2.1 discusses the design for supporting a split-process. Section 2.2 discusses the need to save and restore persistent MPI opaque objects, such as communicators, groups and topologies. Section 2.3 briefly discusses the commonly used algorithm to drain point-to-point MPI messages in transit prior to intiaiting a check- point. Sections 2.4 and 2.5 present a new two-phase algorithm (Algorithm 2), which enables checkpointing in-progress MPI collec- tive communication calls in a fully agnostic environment. Finally, Sections 2.6 and 2.7 present details of the overall implementation of MANA. 2.1 Upper and Lower Half: Checkpointing with an Ephemeral MPI Library In this section, we define the lower half of a split-process as the memory associated with the MPI library and dependencies, includ- ing network libraries. The upper half is the remaining Linux process memory associated with the MPI application’s code, data, stack, and other regions (e.g., environment variables). The terms lower half and upper half are in analogy with the upper and lower half of a device driver in an operating system kernel. This separation into lower and upper half does not involve additional threads or processes. Instead, it serves primarily to tag memory so that only upper half memory will be saved or restored during checkpoint and restart. Section 2.6 describes an additional “helper thread”, but that thread is active only during checkpoint and restart. Libc and other system libraries may appear in both the lower half as a dependency of the MPI libraries, and the upper half as an independent dependency of the MPI application. This split-process approach allows MANA to balance two con- flicting objectives: a shared address space; and isolation of upper and lower halves. The isolation allows MANA to omit the lower half memory (an “ephemeral” MPI library) when it creates a checkpoint image file. The shared address space allows the flow of control to pass efficiently from the upper-half MPI application to the lower- half MPI library through standard C/Fortran calling conventions, including call by reference. As previously noted, Remote Produce Calls (RPC) are not employed. Isolation is needed so that at checkpoint time, the lower half can be omitted from the checkpoint image, and at the time of restart, replaced with a small “bootstrap” MPI program with new MPI li- braries. The bootstrap program calls MPI_Init() and each MPI process discovers its MPI rank via a call to MPI_Rank(). The mem- ory present at this time becomes the lower half. The MPI process then restores the upper-half memory from a checkpoint image file corresponding to the MPI rank id. Control is then transferred back to the upper-half MPI application, and the stack in the lower half is never used again. Shared address space is needed for efficiency. A dual-process proxy approach was explored in [16, Section IV.B] and in [35, Sec- tion IV.A]. The former work reported a 6% runtime overhead for real-world CUDA applications, and the latter work reported run- time overheads in excess of 20% for some OpenCL examples from the NVIDIA SDK 3.0. In contrast, Section 3 reports runtime over- heads less than 2% for MANA under older Linux kernels, and less than 1% runtime overhead for recent Linux kernels. Discarding the lower half greatly simplifies the task of check- pointing. By discarding the lower half, the MPI application in the upper half appears as an isolated process with no inter-process communication. Therefore, a single-process checkpointing package can create a checkpoint image. A minor inconvenience of this split-process approach is that calls to sbrk() will cause the kernel to extend the process heap in the data segment. Calls to sbrk() can be caused by invocations of malloc(). Since the kernel has no concept of a split-process, the kernel may choose, for example, to extend the lower half data segment after restart since that corresponds to the original program seen by the kernel before the upper-half memory is restored. MANA resolves this by interposing on calls to sbrk() in the upper-half libc, and then inserts calls to mmap() to extend the heap of the upper-half. Finally, MANA employs coordinated checkpointing, and a check- point coordinator sends messages to each MPI rank at the time of checkpoint (see Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5). MPI opaque objects (communicators, groups, topologies) are detected on creation and restored on restart (see Section 2.2). This is part of a broader strat- egy by which MPI calls with persistent effects (such as creation of these opaque objects) are recorded during runtime and replayed on restart. 2.2 Checkpointing MPI Communicators, Groups, and Topologies An MPI application can create communication subgroups and topolo- gies to group processes for ease of programmability and efficient communication. MPI implementations provide opaque handles to the application as a reference to a communicator object or group. MANA interposes on all calls that refer to these opaque identi- fiers, and virtualizes the identifiers. At runtime, MANA records any MPI calls that can modify the MPI communication state, such as MPI_Comm_create, MPI_Group_incl, etc. On restart, MANA recre- ates the MPI communicator state by replaying the MPI calls using a new MPI library. The runtime virtualization of identifiers allows the application to continue running with consistent handles across checkpoint-restart. A similar checkpointing strategy also works for other opaque identifiers, such as, MPI derived datatypes, etc. 2.3 Checkpointing MPI Point-to-Point Communication Capturing the state of MPI processes requires quiescing the process threads, and preserving the process memory to a file on the disk. However, this alone is not sufficient to capture a consistent state of the computation. Any MPI messages sent but not yet received at the time of quiescing processes must also be saved as part of the checkpoint image. MANA employs a variation of an all-to-all bookmark exchange algorithm to reach this consistent state. LAM/MPI [31] demon- strated the efficacy of a such a Chandy/Lamport [11] algorithm for checkpointing MPI applications. Hursey et al. [22] lifted this mechanism out of interconnect drivers and into the MPI library. MANA further lifts this mechanism outside the MPI library, and into a virtualized MPI API. An early prototype of MANA demonstrated a naïve application of this bookmark exchange algorithm was sufficient for handling pre-checkpoint draining for point-to-point communication; how- ever, collective-communication calls may have MPI implementation effects that can determine when it is “safe” to begin a checkpoint. For this reason, a naïve application to the entire API was insufficient to ensure correctness. This is discussed in Section 2.4. 2.4 Checkpointing MPI Collectives: Overview The MPI collective communications primitive involves communi- cation amongst all or a program-defined subset of MPI ranks (as specified by the MPI communicator argument to the function). The internal behavior of collectives are specific to each MPI implemen- tation, and so it is not possible to make guarantees about their behavior, such as when and how messages are exchanged when ranks are waiting for one or more ranks to enter the collective. In prior work [22, 31], internal knowledge of the MPI library state was required to ensure that checkpointing would occur at a “safe” state. In particular, Hursey et al. [22] required interconnect drivers be classified as “checkpoint-friendly” or “checkpoint-unfriendly”, changing behavior based on this classification. As MANA lives outside the MPI library, a naive application of the Hursey et al. algorithm can have effects that cross the upper and lower half boundaries of an MPI rank (for example, when shared memory is being used for MPI communication). This problem occurs because of the truly network-agnostic trait of MANA. As MANA has no concept of transport level constructs, it cannot determine what “safe” means in context of collectives. To correct this, MANA’s support for collective communication requires it to maintain the following invariant: No checkpoint must take place while a rank is inside a collective communication call. There exists one exception to this rule: a trivial barrier. A trivial barrier is a simple call to MPI_Barrier(). This call produces no side effects on an MPI rank, and so it can be safely interrupted during checkpoint, and then re-issued when restarting the MPI application. This is possible due to the split-process architecture of MANA, as trivial barrier calls occur exclusively in the lower half, which is discarded and replaced across checkpoint and restart. MANA leverages this exception to build a solution for all other collective calls. As we discuss MANA’s algorithm for checkpointing collective calls, we take into consideration three subtle, but important, con- cerns. Challenge I (consistency): In the case of a single MPI collec- tive communication call, there is a danger that rank A will see a request to checkpoint before entering the collective call, while rank B will see the same request after entering the collective call, in violation of MANA’s invariant. Both ranks might report that they are ready to checkpoint, and the resulting inconsistent snapshot will create problems during restart. This situation could arise, for example, if the mes- sage from the checkpoint coordinator to rank B is excessively delayed in the network. To resolve this, MANA introduces a two-pass protocol in which the coordinator makes a re- quest (sends an intend-to-checkpoint message), each MPI rank acknowledges with its current state, and finally the coordinator posts a checkpoint request (possibly preceded by extra iterations). Challenge II (progress and latency): Given the aforementioned solution for consistency, long delays may occur before a checkpoint request can be serviced. It may be that rank A has entered the barrier, and rank B will require several hours to finish a task before entering the barrier. Hence, the two-pass protocol may create unacceptable delays before a checkpoint can be taken. Algorithm 2 addresses this by introducing a trivial barrier prior to the collective communication call. We refer to this as a two-phase algorithm since each collective call is now replaced by a wrapper function that invokes a trivial barrier call (phase 1) followed by the original collective call (phase 2). Challenge III (multiple collective calls): Until now, it was assumed that at most one MPI collective communication call was in progress at the time of checkpoint. It may happen that there are multiple ongoing collective calls. During the time that some MPI ranks exit from a collective call, it may happen that MPI ranks associated with an independent col- lective call have left the MPI trivial barrier (phase 1) and have now entered the real collective call (phase 2). As a result, servicing a checkpoint may be excessive delayed. To solve this, we introduce an intend-to-checkpoint message, such that no ranks will be allowed to enter phase 2, and extra itera- tions will be inserted into the request-acknowledge protocol between coordinator and MPI rank. 2.5 Checkpointing MPI Collectives: Detailed Algorithm Here we present a single algorithm (Algorithm 2) for checkpointing MPI collectives which contains the elements described in Section 2.4: a multi-iteration protocol; and a two-phase algorithm incorporating a trivial barrier before any collective communication call. From the viewpoint of an MPI application, any call to an MPI collective communication function is interposed on by a wrapper function, as shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Two-Phase collective communication wrapper. (This wrapper function interposes on all MPI collective com- munication functions invoked by an MPI application) 1: function Collective Communication Wrapper 2: # Begin Phase 1 3: Call MPI_Barrier() # trivial barrier 4: # Begin Phase 2 5: Call original MPI collective communication function 6: end function Recall that a trivial barrier is an extra call to MPI_Barrier() prior to a collective call. A collective MPI call can intuitively be divided into two parts: the participating MPI ranks “register” themselves as ready for the collective communication; and then the “work” of communication is carried out. Where the time for the collective communication calls of an MPI program is significant, it is typically due to significant “work” in the second part of the calls. Adding a trivial barrier requires the MPI ranks to register themselves once for the trvial barrier (but no work is involved), and then register themselves again for the actual MPI collective communication. The overhead due to registering twice is tiny in practice. Evidence for this can be seen in the experiments in Section 3.2.3, which show small overhead. The purpose of Algorithm 1 is to enforce the following extension of the invariant presented in Section 2.4: No checkpoint must take place while a rank is inside the collective communication call (Phase 2) of a wrapper function for collective communication (Algorithm 1). We formalize this with the following theorem, which guarantees Algorithm 2 satisfies this invariant. Theorem 1. Under Algorithm 2, an MPI rank is never inside a collective communication call when a checkpoint message is received from the checkpoint coordinator. The proof of this theorem is deferred until the end of this sub- section. We begin the path to this proof by stating an axiom that serves to define the concept of a barrier. Axiom 1. For a given invocation of an MPI barrier, it never happens that a rank A exits from the barrier before another rank B enters the barrier under the “happens-before” relation. Next, we present the following two lemmas. Checkpoint Coordinator Rank A Rank B Barrier (1) (3) (2) (4) Figure 1: Fundamental “happens-before” relation in commu- nication between the checkpoint coordinator and the MPI ranks involved in an MPI barrier. Lemma 1. For a given MPI barrier, if the checkpoint coordinator sends a message to each MPI rank participating in the barrier, and if at least one of the reply messages from the participating ranks reports that its rank has exited the barrier, then the MPI coordinator can send a second message to each participating rank, and each MPI rank will reply that it has entered the barrier (and perhaps also exited the barrier). Proof. We prove the lemma by contradiction. Suppose that the lemma does not hold. Figure 1 shows the general case in which this happens. At event 4, the checkpoint coordinator will conclude that event 1 (rank A has exited the MPI barrier) happened before event 2 (the first reply by each rank), which happened before event 3 (in which rank B has not yet entered the barrier). But this contradicts Axiom 1. Therefore, our assumption is false, and the lemma does indeed hold. □ Lemma 2. Recall that an MPI collective communication wrapper makes a call to a trivial barrier and then makes an MPI collective communication call. For a given invocation of an MPI collective com- munication wrapper, we know that one of four cases must hold: (a) an MPI rank is in the collective communication call, and all other ranks are either in the call, or have exited; (b) an MPI rank is in the collective communication call, and no rank has exited, and every other rank has at least entered the trivial barrier (and possibly proceeded further); (c) an MPI rank is in the trivial barrier and no other rank has exited (but some may not yet have entered the trivial barrier); (d) either no MPI rank has entered the trivial barrier, or all MPI ranks have exited the MPI collective communication call. Proof. The proof is by repeated application of Lemma 1. For case a, if an MPI rank is in the collective communication call and another rank has exited the collective call, then Lemma 1 says that there cannot be any rank that has not yet entered the collective call. For case b, note that if an MPI rank is in the collective communi- cation call, then that rank has exited the trivial barrier. Therefore, by Lemma 1, all other ranks have at least entered the trivial barrier. Further, we can assume that no ranks that have exited the collec- tive call, since we would otherwise be in case a, which is already accounted for. For case c, note that if an MPI rank is in the trivial barrier and no rank has exited the trivial barrier, then Lemma 1 says that there cannot be any rank that has not yet entered the trivial barrier. Finally, if we are not in case a, b, or c, then the only remaining possibility is case d: all ranks have not yet entered the trivial barrier or all ranks have exited the collective call. □ Algorithm 2 Two-Phase algorithm for deadlock-free check- pointing of MPI collectives 1: Messages: {intend-to-checkpoint, extra-iteration, do-ckpt} 2: MPI states: {ready, in-phase-1, exit-phase-2} 3: Process Checkpoint Coordinator do 4: function Begin Checkpoint 5: send intend-to-ckpt msg to all ranks 6: receive responses from each rank 7: while some rank in state exit-phase-2 do 8: send extra-iteration msg to all ranks 9: receive responses from each rank 10: end while 11: send do-ckpt msg to all ranks 12: end function 13: Process MPI Rank do 14: upon event intend-to-ckpt msg or extra-iteration msg do 15: if not inCollectiveWrapper then 16: reply to ckpt coord: state ←ready 17: end if 18: if inCollectiveWrapper and in Phase 1 then 19: reply to ckpt coord: state ←in-phase-1 20: end if 21: if inCollectiveWrapper and in Phase 2 then 22: # guaranteed ckpt coord won’t request ckpt here 23: finish executing coll. comm. call 24: reply to ckpt coord: state ←exit-phase-2 25: # ckpt coord can request ckpt after this 26: set state ←ready 27: end if 28: continue, but wait before next coll. comm. call 29: upon event do-ckpt msg do 30: # guaranteed now that no rank is in phase 2 during ckpt 31: do local checkpoint for this rank 32: # all ranks may now continue executing 33: if this rank is waiting before coll. comm. call then 34: unblock this rank and continue executing 35: end if We now continue with the proof of the main theorem (Theo- rem 1), which was deferred earlier. Proof. (Proof of Theorem 1 for Algorithm 2.) Lemma 2 states that one of four cases must hold in a call by MANA to an MPI collective communication wrapper. We wish to exclude the possibility that an MPI rank is in the collective communication call (case a or b of the lemma) when the checkpoint coordinator invokes a checkpoint. In Algorithm 2, assume that the checkpoint coordinator has sent an intend-to-ckpt message, and has not yet sent a do-ckpt message. An MPI rank will either reply with state ready or in-phase-1 (show- ing that it is not in the collective communication call and that it will stop before entering the collective communication call), or else it must be in Phase 2 of the wrapper (potentially within the collective communication call), and it will not reply to the coordinator until exiting the collective call. □ Theorem 2. Under Algorithm 2, deadlock will never occur. Further, the delay between the time when all ranks have received the intend- to-checkpoint message and the time when the do-ckpt message has been sent is bounded by the maximum time for any individual MPI rank to enter and exit the collective communication call, plus network message latency. Proof. The algorithm will never deadlock, since each rank must either make progress based on the normal MPI operation or else it stops before the collective communication call. If any rank replies with the state exit-phase-2, then the checkpoint coordinator will send an additional extra-iteration message. So, at the time of check- point, all ranks will have state ready or in-phase-1. Next, the delay between the time when all ranks have received the intend-to-checkpoint message and the time when the do-ckpt message has been sent is clearly bounded by the maximum time for an individual MPI rank to enter and exit the collective commu- nication call, plus the usual network message latency. This is the case since once the intend-to-checkpoint message is received, no MPI rank may enter the collective communication call. So, upon re- ceiving the intend-to-checkpoint message, either the rank is already in Phase 2 or else it will remain in Phase 1. □ Implementation of Algorithm 2: At the time of process launch for an MPI rank, a separate checkpoint helper thread is also in- jected into each rank. This thread is responsible for listening to checkpoint-related messages from a separate coordinator process and then responding. This allows the MPI rank to asynchronously process events based on messages received from the checkpoint coordinator. Furthermore at the time of checkpoint, the existing threads of the MPI rank process are quiesced (paused) by the helper thread, and the helper thread carries out the checkpointing require- ments, such as copying the upper-half memory regions to stable storage. The coordinator process does not participate in the check- pointing directly. In the implementation, a DMTCP coordinator and DMTCP checkpoint thread [1] are modified to serve as checkpoint coordinator and helper thread, respectively. 2.6 Verification with TLA+/PlusCal To gain further confidence in our implementation for handling collective communication (Section 2.5), we developed a model for the protocol in TLA+ [25] and then used the PlusCal model checker of TLA+ based on TLC [38] to verify Algorithm 2. Specifically, PlusCal was used to verify the algorithm invariants of deadlock- free execution and consistent state when multiple concurrent MPI processes are executing. The PlusCal model checker did not report any deadlocks or broken invariants for our implementation. 2.7 Checkpoint/Restart Package Any single-process checkpointing package could be utilized for the basis of implementing MANA. This work presents a prototype implemented by extending DMTCP [1] and by developing a DMTCP plugin [2]. Cao et al. [9] demonstrated that DMTCP can checkpoint MPI-based HPCG over 32,752 CPU cores (38 TB) in 11 minutes, and MPI-based NAMD over 16,368 cores (10 TB) in 2.6 minutes. DMTCP uses a helper thread inside each application process, and a coordinated checkpointing protocol by using a centralized coor- dinator daemon. Since this was close to the design requirements of MANA, we leveraged this infrastructure and extended the DMTCP coordinator to implement the two-phase algorithm. The same approach could be extended to base MANA on top of a different underlying transparent checkpointing package. For example, one could equally well have modified an existing MPI co- ordinator process to communicate with a custom helper thread in each MPI rank that then invokes the BLCR checkpointing package when it is required to execute the checkpoint. In particular, all sock- ets and other network communication objects are inside the lower half, and so even a single-process or single-host checkpointing package such as BLCR would suffice for this work. 3 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION This section seeks to answer the following questions: Q1: What is the runtime overhead of running MPI applications under MANA? Q2: What are the checkpoint and restart overheads of transparent checkpointing of MPI applications under MANA? Q3: Can MANA allow transparent switching of MPI implementa- tions across checkpoint-restart for the purpose of load balancing? 3.1 Setup We first describe the hardware and software setup for MANA’s evaluation. 3.1.1 Hardware. The experiments were run on the Cori supercom- puter [13] at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). As of this writing, Cori is the #12 supercomputer in the Top-500 list [36]. All experiments used the Intel Haswell nodes (dual socket with a 16-core Xeon E5-2698 v3 each) connected via Cray’s Aries interconnect network. Checkpoints were saved to the backend Lustre filesystem. 3.1.2 Software. Cori provides modules for two implementations of MPI: Intel MPI and Cray MPICH. The Cray compiler (based on an Intel compiler) and Cray MPICH are the recommended way to use MPI, presumably for reasons of performance. Cray MPICH version 3.0 was used for the experiments. 3.1.3 Application Benchmarks. MANA was tested with five real- world HPC applications from different computational science do- mains: (1) GROMACS [4]: Versatile package for molecular dynamics, often used for biochemical molecules. (2) CLAMR [12, 29]: Mini-application for CelL-based Adaptive Mesh Refinement. 90 95 100 Normalized Performance (%) GROMACS miniFE HPCG CLAMR LULESH 1 2 4 8 16 32 0 1 2 4 8 16 32 1 2 4 8 16 32 # MPI Rank(s) (Single node) 1 2 4 8 16 32 1 9 27 Figure 2: Single Node: Runtime overhead under MANA for different real-world HPC benchmarks with an unpatched Linux kernel.

(4) LULESH [24]: Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hy- drodynamics (5) HPCG [14] (High Performance Conjugate Gradient): Uses a variety of linear algebra operations to match a broad set of important HPC applications, and used for ranking HPC systems. 3.2 Runtime Overhead 3.2.1 Real-world HPC Applications. Next, we evaluate the perfor- mance of MANA for real-world HPC applications. It will be shown that the runtime overhead is close to 0 % for miniFE and HPCG, and as much as 2 % for the other three applications. The higher overhead has been tracked down to an inefficiency in the Linux ker- nel [27] in the case of many point-to-point MPI calls (send/receive) with messages of small size. This worst case is analyzed further in Section 3.3, where tests with an optimized Linux kernel show a worst case runtime overhead of 0.6 %. The optimized Linux kernel is based on a patch under review for a future Linux version. Single Node: Since the tests were performed within a larger clus- ter where the network use of other jobs could create congestion, we first eliminate any network-related overhead by running the benchmarks on a single node with multiple MPI ranks, both under 0 1000000 2000000 3000000 4000000 Size (Bytes) 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 Bandwidth (MB/s) Without MANA With MANA (native kernel) With MANA (patched kernel) Figure 4: Point-to-Point Bandwidth under MANA with patched and unpatched Linux kernel. (Higher is better.) MANA and natively (without MANA). This experiment isolates the single-node runtime overhead of MANA by ensuring that all communication among ranks is intra-node. Figure 2 shows the results for the five different real-world HPC applications running on a single node under MANA. Each run was repeated 5 times (including the native runs), and the figure shows the mean of the 5 runs. The absolute runtimes varied from 4.5 min to 15 min, depending on the configuration. The worst case overhead incurred by MANA is 2.1 % in the case of GROMACS (with 16 MPI ranks). In most cases, the mean overhead is less than 2 %. Multiple Nodes: Next, the scaling of MANA across the network is examined for up to 64 compute nodes and with 32 ranks per node (except for LULESH, whose configuration restricts the number of ranks/node based on the number of nodes). Hence, the number of MPI ranks ranges from 64 to 2048. Figure 3 shows the results of five different real-world HPC ap- plications running on multiple nodes under MANA. Each run was repeated 5 times, and the mean of 5 runs is reported. We observe a trend similar to the single node case. MANA imposes an overhead of typically less than 2 %. The highest overhead observed is 4.5 % in the case of GROMACS (512 ranks running over 16 nodes). However, see Section 3.3 where we demonstrate a reduced overhead of 0.6 % with GROMACS. 3.2.2 Memory Overhead. The upper-half libraries were built with mpicc, and hence include additional copies of the MPI library that are not used. However, the upper-half MPI library is never ini- tialized, and so no network library is ever loaded into the upper half. Since a significant portion of the lower half is comprised only of the MPI library and its dependencies, the additional copy of the libraries (with one copy residing in the upper half) imposes a constant memory overhead. This text segment (code region) was 26 MB in all of our experiments on Cori with the Cray MPI library. In addition to the code, the libraries (for example, the networking driver library) in the lower half also allocate additional memory regions (shared memory regions, pinned memory regions, memory- mapped driver regions). We observed that the shared memory re- gions mapped by the network driver library grow in proportion with the number of nodes (up to 64 nodes): from 2 MB (for 2 nodes) to 40 MB for (64 nodes). We expect MANA to have a reduced check- point time compared to DMTCP/InfiniBand [10], as MANA discards these regions during checkpointing, reducing the amount of data that’s written out to the disk. 0 1000000 2000000 3000000 4000000 Size (Bytes) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Latency (µs) Without MANA With MANA (a) Point-to-Point Latency 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 1000000 Size (Bytes) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 Latency (µs) Without MANA With MANA (b) Collective MPI_Gather 0 200000 400000 600000 800000 1000000 Size (Bytes) 0 100 200 300 400 500 Latency (µs) Without MANA With MANA (c) Collective MPI_Allreduce Figure 5: OSU Micro-benchmarks under MANA. (Results are for two MPI ranks on a single node.) 3.2.3 Microbenchmarks. To dig deeper into the sources for the run- time overhead, we tested MANA with the OSU micro-benchmarks. The benchmarks stress and evaluate the bandwidth and latency of different specific MPI subsystems. Our choice of the specific micro-benchmarks was motivated by the MPI calls commonly used by our real-world MPI applications. Figure 5 shows the results with three benchmarks from the OSU micro-benchmark suite. These benchmarks correspond with the most frequently used MPI subsystems in the set of real-world HPC applications. The benchmarks were run with 2 MPI ranks running on a single compute node. The results show that latency does not suffer under MANA, for both point-to-point and collective communication. (The latency curves for application running under MANA closely follow the curves when the application is run natively.) 3.3 Source of Overhead and Improved Overhead for Patched Linux Kernel All experiments in this section were performed on a single node of our local cluster, where it was possible to directly install a patched Linux kernel in the bare machine. Further investigation revealed two sources of runtime overhead. The larger source of overhead is due to the use of the “FS” register during transfer of flow of control between the upper and lower half and back during a call to the MPI library in the lower half. The “FS” register of the x86-64 CPU is used by most compilers to refer to the thread-local variables declared in the source code. The upper and lower half programs each have their own thread-local storage region. Hence, when switching between the upper and lower half programs, the value of the “FS” register must be changed to point to the correct thread-local region. Most Linux kernels today require a kernel call to invoke a privileged assembly instruction to get or set the “FS” register. In 2011, Intel Ivy Bridge CPUs introduced a new, unprivileged FSGSBASE assembly instruction for modifying the “FS” register, and a patch to the Linux kernel [27] is under review to allow other Linux programs to use this more efficient mechanism for managing the “FS” register. (Other architectures, such as ARM, use unprivileged addressing modes for thread-local variables that do not depend on special constructs, such as the x86 segments.) A second (albeit smaller) source of overhead is the virtualization of MPI communicators and datatypes, and recording of metadata for MPI sends and receives. Virtualization requires a hash table lookup and locks for thread safety. The first and larger source of overhead is then eliminated by using the patched Linux kernel, as discussed above. Point-to-point bandwidth benchmarks were run both with and without the patched Linux kernel (Figure 4). A degradation in runtime performance is seen for MANA for small message sizes (less than 1 MB) in the case of a native kernel. However, the figure shows that the patched kernel yields much reduced runtime overhead for MANA. Note that the Linux kernel community is actively reviewing this patch (currently in its third version), and it is likely to be incorporated in future Linux releases. Finally, we return to GROMACS, since it exhibited a higher runtime overhead (e.g., 2.1 % in the case of 16 ranks) in many cases. We did a similar experiment, running GROMACS with 16 MPI ranks on a single node with the patched kernel. With the patched kernel, the performance degradation was reduced to 0.6 %. 3.4 Checkpoint-restart Overhead In this section, we evaluate MANA’s performance when checkpoint- ing and restarting HPC applications. Figure 6 shows the checkpoint- ing overhead for five different real-world HPC applications running on multiple nodes under MANA. Each run was repeated 5 times, and the mean of five runs is reported. For each run, we use the fsync system call to ensure the data is flushed to the Lustre backend storage. The total checkpointing data written at each checkpoint varies from 5.9 GB (in the case of 64 ranks of GROMACS running over 2 nodes) to 4 TB (in the case of 2048 ranks of HPCG running over 64 nodes). Note that the checkpointing overhead is proportional to the total amount of memory used by the benchmark. This is also reflected in the size of the checkpoint image per MPI rank. While Figure 6 reports the overall checkpoint time, note that there is significant variation in the write times for each MPI rank during a given run. (The time for one rank to write its checkpoint data can be up to 4 times more than that for 90 % of the other ranks.) This phenomenon of stragglers during a parallel write has also been noted by other researchers [2, 37]. Thus, the overall checkpoint time is bottlenecked by the checkpoint time of the slowest rank. Next, we ask what are the sources of the checkpointing overhead? Does the draining of MPI messages and the two-phase algorithm impose a significant overhead at checkpoint time? 2 4 8 16 32 64 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Checkpoint Time (s) (93 MB) (93 MB) (92 MB) (92 MB) (94 MB) (92 MB) GROMACS 2 4 8 16 32 64 (2.0 GB) (1.3 GB) (806 MB) (1.3 GB) (902 MB) (1.3 GB) miniFE 2 4 8 16 32 64 # Compute Nodes (32 ranks/node, except LULESH) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) (2.0 GB) HPCG 2 4 8 16 32 64 (656 MB) (594 MB) (552 MB) (501 MB) (594 MB) (552 MB) CLAMR 2 4 8 16 32 64 (276 MB) (164 MB) (114 MB) (91 MB) (85 MB) (88 MB) LULESH Figure 6: Checkpointing overhead and checkpoint image sizes under MANA for different real-world HPC bench- marks running on multiple nodes. In all cases, except LULESH, 32 MPI ranks were executed on each compute node. For LULESH, the total number of ranks was either 64 (for 2, 4, and 8 nodes), or 512 (for 16, 32, and 64 nodes). Hence, the maximum number of ranks (for 64 nodes) was 2048. The numbers above the bars (in parentheses) indicate the check- point image size for each MPI rank. 2 4 8 16 32 64 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 Restart Time (s) GROMACS 2 4 8 16 32 64 miniFE 2 4 8 16 32 64 # Compute Nodes (32 ranks/node, except LULESH) HPCG 2 4 8 16 32 64 CLAMR 2 4 8 16 32 64 LULESH Figure 7: Restart overhead under MANA for different real- world HPC benchmarks running on multiple nodes. In all cases, except LULESH, 32 MPI ranks were executed on each compute node. Ranks/node is as in Figure 6. Figure 8 shows the contribution of different components to the checkpointing overhead for the case of 64 nodes for the five different benchmarks. In all cases, the communication overhead for handling MPI collectives in the two-phase algorithm of Section 2.5 is found to be less than 1.6 s. In all cases, the time to drain in-flight MPI messages was less than 0.7 s. The total checkpoint time was dominated by the time to write to the storage system.

The communi- cation overhead is the time required in the protocol for net- work communication between the checkpoint coordinator and each rank. overhead was the communication overhead. The current imple- mentation of the checkpointing protocol in DMTCP uses TCP/IP sockets for communication between the MPI ranks and the central- ized DMTCP coordinator. The communication overhead associated with the TCP layer is found to increase with the number of ranks, especially due to metadata in the case of small messages that are exchanged between MPI ranks and the coordinator. Finally, Figure 7 shows the restart overhead under MANA for the different MPI benchmarks. The restart time varies from less than 10 s to 68 s (for 2048 ranks of HPCG running over 64 nodes). The restart times increase in proportion to the total amount of checkpointing data that is read from the storage. In all the cases, the restart overhead is dominated by the time to read the data from the disk. The time to recreate the MPI opaque identifiers (see Section 2.2) is less than 10 % of the total restart time. 3.5 Transparent Switching of MPI libraries across Checkpoint-restart This section demonstrates that MANA can transparently switch between different MPI implementations across checkpoint-restart. This is useful for debugging programs (even the MPI library) as it allows a program to switch from a production version of an MPI library to a debug version of the MPI library. The GROMACS application is launched using the production version of CRAY MPI, and a checkpoint is taken 55 s into the run. The computation is then restarted on top of a custom-compiled debug version of MPICH (for MPICH version 3.3). MPICH was chosen because it is a reference implementation whose simplicity makes it easy to instrument for debugging. 3.6 Transparent Migration across Clusters Next, we consider cross-cluster migration for purposes of wide- area load balancing either among clusters at a single HPC site or even among multiple HPC sites. This is rarely done, since the two common vehicles for transparent checkpoint (BLCR as the base of 190 200 210 220 Runtime (s) Native Restarted (migrated from Cori) Open MPI/IB (2x4) MPICH/TCP (2x4) MPICH (8x1) Restart Configuration 0 Figure 9: Performance degradation of GROMACS after cross- cluster migration under three different restart configura- tions. The application was restarted after being check- pointed at the half-way mark on Cori. (Lower is better.) an MPI-specific checkpoint-restart service; or DMTCP/InfiniBand) both save the MPI library within the checkpoint image and continue to use that same MPI library on the remote cluster after migration. At each site and for each cluster, administrators typically configure and tune a locally recommended MPI implementation for perfor- mance. Migrating an MPI application along with its underlying MPI library destroys the benefit of this local performance tuning. This experiment showcases the benefits of MPI-agnostic, network- agnostic support for transparent checkpointing. GROMACS is run under MANA, initially running on Cori with a statically linked Cray MPI library running over the Cray Aries network. GROMACS on Cori is configured to run with 8 ranks over 4 nodes (2 ranks per node). Each GROMACS rank is single-threaded. A checkpoint was then taken exactly half way into the run. The checkpoints were then migrated to a local cluster that uses Open MPI over the InfiniBand network. The restarted GROMACS under MANA was compared with three other configurations: GROMACS using the local Open MPI, con- figured to use the local InfiniBand network (8 ranks over 2 nodes); GROMACS/MPICH, configured to use TCP (8 ranks over 2 nodes); and GROMACS/MPICH, running on a single node (8 ranks over 1 node). The network-agnostic nature of MANA allowed the Cori version of GROMACS to be restarted on the local cluster with any of three network options. We wished to isolate the effects due to MANA from the effects due to different compilers on Cori and the local cluster. In order to accomplish this, the native GROMACS on the local cluster was com- piled specially. The Cray compiler of Cori (using Intel’s C compiler) was used to generate object files (.o files) on Cori. Those object files were copied to the local cluster. The native GROMACS was then built using the local mpicc, but with the (.o files) as input instead of the (.c files). The local mpicc linked these files with the local MPI implementation, and the native application was then launched in the traditional way. Figure 9 shows that GROMACS’s performance degrades by less than 1.8% post restart on the local cluster for the three different restart configurations (compared to the corresponding native runs). Also, note that the performance of GROMACS under MANA post restart closely tracks the performance of the native configuration. 4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK Next, we discuss both the limitations and some future implications of this work concerning dynamic load balancing. 4.1 Limitations While the split-process approach for checkpointing and process migration is quite flexible, it does include some limitations inherited by any approach based on transparent checkpointing. Naturally, when restarting on a different architecture, the CPU instruction set must be compatible. In particular, on the x86 architecture, the MPI application code must be compiled to the oldest x86 sub-architecture among those remote clusters where one might consider restarting a checkpoint image. (However, the MPI libraries themselves may be fully optimized for the local architecture, since restarting on a remote cluster implies using a new lower half.) Similarly, while MPI implies a standard API, any local extensions to MPI must be avoided. The application binary interface (ABI) used by the compiled MPI application must either be compatible or else a “shim” layer of code must be inserted in the wrapper functions for calling from the upper half to the lower half. And of course, the use of a checkpoint coordinator implies coor- dinated checkpointing. If a single MPI rank crashes, MANA must restore the entire MPI computation from an earlier checkpoint. 4.2 Future Work MPI version 3 has added nonblocking collective communication calls (e.g., MPI_Igather). In future work, we propose to extend the two-phase algorithm for collective communication of Section 2.5 to the nonblocking case. The approach to be explored would be to employ a first phase that uses a nonblocking trivial barrier (MPI_Ibarrier), and to then convert the actual asynchronous col- lective call to a synchronous collective call (e.g., MPI_Gather to MPI_Igather) for the second phase. Nonblocking variations of col- lective communication calls are typically used as performance op- timizations in an MPI application. If an MPI rank reaches the col- lective communication early, then instead of blocking, it can con- tinue with an alternate compute task while occasionally testing (via MPI_Test/MPI_Wait) to see if the other ranks have all reached the barrier. In the two-phase analog, a wrapper around the nonblocking collective communication causes MPI_Ibarrier to be invoked. When the ranks have all reached the nonblocking trivial barrier and the MPI_Test/MPI_Wait calls of the original MPI application reports completion of the MPI_Ibarrier call of phase 1, then this implies that the ranks are all ready to enter the actual collective call of phase 2. A wrapper around MPI_Test/MPI_Wait can then invoke the actual collective call of phase 2. The split-process approach of MANA opens up some impor- tant new features in managing long-running MPI applications. An immediately obvious feature is the possibility of switching in the middle of a long run to a customized MPI implementation. Hence, one can dynamically substitute a customized MPI for performance analysis (e.g., using PMPI for profiling or tracing); or using a spe- cially compiled “debug” version of MPI to analyze a particular but occurring in the MPI library in the middle of a long run. This work also helps support many tools and proposals for opti- mizing MPI applications. For example, a trace analyzer is sometimes used to discover communication hotspots and opportunities for bet- ter load balancing. Such results are then fed back by re-configuring the binding of MPI ranks to specific hosts in order to better fit the underlying interconnect topology. MANA can enable new approaches to dynamically load balance across clusters and also to re-bind MPI ranks in the middle of a long run to create new configurations of rank-to-host bindings (new topology mappings). Currently, such bindings are chosen statically and used for the entire lifetime of the MPI application run. This added flexibility allows system managers to burst current long- running applications into the Cloud during periods of heavy usage or when the the MPI application enters a new phase for which a different rank-to-host binding is optimal. Finally, MANA can enable a new class of very long-running MPI applications — ones which may outlive the lifespan of the original MPI Implementation, cluster, or even the network interconnect. Such temporally complex computations might be discarded as in- feasible today without the ability to migrate MPI implementations or clusters. 5 RELATED WORK Hursey et al. [22] developed a semi-network-agnostic checkpoint service for Open-MPI. It applied an “MPI Message” abstraction to a Chandy/Lamport algorithm [11], greatly reducing the complexity to support checkpoint/restart for many multiple network intercon- nects. However, it also highlighted the weakness of implementing transparent checkpointing within the MPI library, since porting to an additional MPI implementation would likely require as much software development as for the first MPI implementation. Addi- tionally, its dependence on BLCR imposed a large overhead cost, as it lacks support for SysV shared memory. Separate proxy processes for high- and low-level operations have been proposed both by CRUM (for CUDA) and McKernel (for the Linux kernel). CRUM [16] showed that by running a non-reentrant library in a separate process, one can work around the problem of a library “polluting” the address space of the application process — i.e., creating and leaving side-effects in the application process’s address space. This decomposition of a single application process into two processes, however, forces the transfer of data between two processes via RPC, which can cause a large overhead. McKernel [17] runs a “lightweight” kernel along with a full- fledged Linux kernel. The HPC application runs on the lightweight kernel, which implements time-critical system calls. The rest of the functionality is offloaded to a proxy process running on the Linux kernel. The proxy process is mapped in the address space of the main application, similar to MANA’s concept of a lower half, to min- imize the overhead of “call forwarding” (argument marshalling/un- marshalling). In general, a proxy process approach is problematic for MPI, since it can lead to additional jitter as the operating system tries to schedule the extra proxy process alongside the application pro- cess. The jitter harms performance since the MPI computation is constrained to complete no faster than its slowest MPI rank. Process-in-process [21] has in common with MANA that both approaches load multiple programs into a single address space. However, the goal of process-in-process was intra-node communi- cation optimization, and not checkpoint-restart. Process-in-process loads all MPI ranks co-located on the same node as separate threads within a single process, but in different logical “namespaces”, in the sense of the dlmopen namespaces in Linux. It would be diffi- cult to adapt process-in-process for use in checkpoint-restart since that approach implies a single “ld.so” run-time linker library that managed all of the MPI ranks. In particular, difficulties occur when restarting with fresh MPI libraries while “ld.so” retains pointers to destructor functions in the pre-checkpoint MPI libraries. In the special regime of application-specific checkpointing for bulk synchronous MPI applications, Sultana et al. [33] supported checkpointing by separately saving and restoring MPI state (MPI identifiers such as communicators, and so on). This is combined with application-specific code to save the application state. Thus, when a live process fails, it is restored using these two components, without the need restart the overall MPI job. SCR [32], and FTI [3] are other application-specific checkpoint- ing techniques. An application developer declares memory regions they’d like to checkpoint and checkpointing can only be done at specific points in the program determined by the application devel- oper. Combining these techniques with transparent checkpointing is outside the scope of this work, though it is an interesting avenue for further inquiry. In general, application-specific and transparent checkpointing each have their merits. Both application-specific and transparent checkpointing are used in practice. At the high end of HPC, application-specific checkpointing is preferred since the labor for supporting this is small compared to the labor already invested in supporting an extreme HPC application. At the low and medium end of HPC, developers prefer trans- parent checkpointing because the development effort for the soft- ware is more moderate, and the labor overhead of a specialized application-specific checkpointing solution would then be signif- icant. System architectures based on burst buffers (e.g., Cray’s DataWarp [19]) can be used to reduce the checkpointing overhead for both application-specific and transparent checkpointing. 6 CONCLUSION This work presents an MPI-Agnostic, Network-Agnostic transpar- ent checkpointing methodology for MPI (MANA), based on a split- process mechanism. The runtime overhead is typically less than 2%, even in spite of the overhead incurred by the current Linux ker- nel when the “FS” register is modified each time control passes between upper and lower half. Further, Section 3.3 shows that a commit (patch) to fix this by the Linux kernel developers is un- der review and that this commit reduces the runtime overhead of GROMACS from 2.1% to 0.6% using the patched kernel. Similar reductions to about 0.6% runtime overhead are expected in the general case. An additional major novelty is the demonstration of practical, efficient migration between clusters at different sites using differ- ent networks and different configurations of CPU cores per node. This was considered impractical in the past because a checkpoint image from one cluster will not be tuned for optimal performance on the second cluster. Section 3.6 demonstrates that this is now feasible, and that the migration of a GROMACS job with 8 MPI ranks experiences an average runtime overhead of less than 1.8% as compared to the native GROMACS application (without MANA) on the remote cluster. As before, even this overhead of 1.8% is likely to be reduced to about 0.6% in the future, based on the results of Section 3.3 with a patched Linux kernel.",1883

Over time, the software testbench-based emulation environments have become very popular, since the users can control its operation remotely from their desktops. This makes emulators an enterprise resource, accessible to a multitude of users spread across continents and multiple time zones. And since emulators are expensive resources, it is important to utilize them efficiently. Full checkpoint save/restore capability of emulation jobs helps the utilization by enabling flexible job scheduling, shortening of jobs by jumping ahead to interesting points for debug, carrying out what-if analysis, etc. Emulators have native save/restore capabilities for the model on the emulator. The software testbenches can be complex in multiple dimensions. For example, they may be using C/C++, SystemC, SystemVerilog, etc. They may be multi- threaded and based on multiple processes, they may be using IPC, and so on. It then becomes a challenge to save the states of such sophisticated software testbenches both transparently and through a uniform, reliable, mechanism. Since the objective is to solve the problem at an enterprise level, it is critical to find a uniform solution for a diverse set of software testbenches throughout the enterprise. The DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) package supports such a uniform solution. This paper describes the integration of DMTCP with a virtual testbench-based emulation. This brings large benefits to a real life environment that includes multiple emulators within the larger set of enterprise resources. There are other, additional applications of full checkpoint save/restore for emulation jobs that become apparent only after having gained experience with its use in job management. For example, after having observed the behavior of an application prior to checkpoint, additional triggers can be inserted at the time of restore, to enhance debugging of an exception or other unusual behavior.s. II. BACKGROUND: CO-MODELING AND DMTCP A. Review of Co-Modeling Architecture Co-emulation, or (transaction-level) Co-Modeling, is the process of modeling cycle-accurate synthesizable hardware models (DUTs) running on an emulator, communicating with testbenches at transaction level via a high- speed link between the emulator and the host system. The reusable testbenches are interfaced to synthesizable transactors co-located with the DUT in the emulator. These “accelerated” transactors convert high-level transactions to signal-level stimuli to drive the DUT. During an emulation run, the hardware communicates with the software testbench using a high-speed link. For every DUT clock or for each time point in the model execution, communication may be required by one or more synthesizable transactors. In the general case, the DUT clocks will be suspended at times to complete all the communication requests for a given point in the model execution. So at any point of time, there could be inflight data in the link. Figure 1. Co-Modeling Architecture B. Review of DMTCP flow DMTCP is an open-source package that provides a capability for Checkpoint/Restart in applications involving multiple processes/threads distributed across multiple hosts and connected by socket connections. The package can be downloaded from: http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net It operates under Linux, with no modifications to the Linux kernel or to the user code, and it can be used by unprivileged users (no root privilege needed). One can later restart from a checkpoint, or even migrate the processes by moving the checkpoint files to another host prior to restarting. Figure 2 shows the typical flow of a user job under DMTCP. Figure 2. Typical flow of a user job under DMTCP A detailed description on DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) internals can be found in [1]. DMTCP also provides a flexible plugin model that supports the ability to write an add-on library that can: support DMTCP event hooks; add custom wrappers around system calls; and add a custom distributed name service facility [2, 3]. III. MOTIVATING USE CASES Checkpoint-restore of emulation jobs opens a wide of range of applications, which will help users build a fault- tolerant emulation system, powerful debug mechanisms, and increase usage efficiency of critical resources like hardware emulators. This section describes different use cases for such capability in emulation. The following section, Section IV, then presents the Checkpoint/Restore Framework in detail. A. Skipping repeated initial sequences Designs may have an initialization phase that is always executed for each test. This may be a hardware reset phase or boot-up, which takes a great deal of time before an actual test can start. We can save much of the emulation runtime by taking a checkpoint right after this repeated initial sequence. New tests can then just restart immediately after this initial sequence, thus saving a great deal of regression time. Another application of this is to do what-if analysis after reaching an interesting point in the execution. In Figure 3, each test Test0, Test1, Test2 executes the same initial sequence, which takes C1 time. Figure 3. Job Progress with fixed initialization sequence The tests then follow their own unique paths, completing the test in different time intervals (T0, T1, and T2). This C1 time is saved if we checkpoint just after completion of the initial sequence and then restore from the checkpoint at the original state in each test. B. Better Job Management Policies One of the advantages of virtualization of test environments is the ability to use emulators remotely. This allows emulation to be moved to the data center, with jobs being managed by a workload management platform such as LSF. However, the non-pre-emptive nature of emulation jobs forbids pre-emptive scheduling policies. This prevents a high-priority job from acquiring the resources occupied by a currently executing low-priority job. For example, a currently running long job cannot be removed even though a short job has just arrived. The short job has to wait until the long job exits and frees up the resources. Hence, the non-pre-emptive nature of emulation jobs can easily lead to inefficient use of emulators. Consider the scenario depicted in Figure 4: Figure 4. Job Management Job1 occupies 4 slots on Emulator1 and Job2 occupies 2 slots on Emulator2. Further a high-priority request from Job3 arrives for 6 resources. As resources are fragmented, irrespective of its priority, Job3 has to wait for either of Job1 or Job2 to finish. The Checkpoint/Restore capability can remove this shortcoming and enable a pre-emptive scheduling policy. We could have checkpointed either of Job1 or Job2 and freed up the resources for Job3. Whenever resources become available, the checkpointed job can then be restarted using the DMTCP restart scripts. Further, this situation also leads to inefficient use of emulators due to resource fragmentation within each emulator. Using Checkpoint/Restore we could have migrated an interfering job to a different emulator, thereby making contiguous resources available for the new job. In Figure 5, the checkpoint of Job2 is taken first, and then Job2 is restarted on Emulator1. This frees up all 6 slots on Emulator2 for Job3. Job3 can now be allocated using contiguous resources on Emulator2. Figure 5. Resource free with Job Migration Another interesting example concerns the issue of “fairness” for large-capacity jobs. In a distribution system dominated by high-priority, small-capacity jobs, a low-priority large-capacity job may never actually get a chance to run if the policy is to wait for required slots to become available. Further, a high-priority long job can lead to underutilization of emulation resources as freed slots cannot be allocated for other small jobs if they have to be pooled for a high-priority long job waiting in the queue. With checkpoint-restart, one can save all the small jobs at once, run the large job and then restart the small jobs. A long low-priority job might otherwise never get an opportunity to complete, if not for the use of checkpoint-restart. There are several such instances where checkpoint- restart can offer this kind of flexibility in an emulation job scheduling system. C. Debugging from past simulation time Debugging is an important requirement for verification engineers. Much time is spent in debugging functional issues in design as well as integration issues with software during validation of a full SoC. The ability to take a checkpoint of the full system can provide capabilities to start debugging just before an issue occurs, by restarting from the point of a previous checkpoint state. For example, one can take periodic checkpoints and when a problem is seen: start from the last checkpoint, run again and capture more debug information. This is a tremendous advantage when a debugging issue occurs only after a run of long duration. A large amount of time is saved, since one no longer needs to wait for the test to arrive at the point of interest. IV. CHECKPOINT/RESTORE FRAMEWORK In this section we describe the implementation of checkpoint-restore for emulation jobs. We address checkpoint and restore separately. Figure 6 shows the typical flow of an emulation job under DMTCP. Note that in Figure 2, the checkpoint was invoked by the user at an arbitrary point in time. However, in the emulation flow (Figure 6), the user invokes the checkpoint programmatically from within the user code, when the simulation reaches certain number of cycles. Figure 6. Typical flow of an emulation job under DMTCP. A. Checkpoint Checkpointing of emulation jobs involves both the emulator and the testbench on the workstation. One must save the simulation state for the design running on an emulator, while also employing binary-level checkpointing using DMTCP for the processes representing the testbench side and running on the workstation. As always, we have to make sure that the hardware side stops generating further transactions when a checkpoint is in progress. In addition, checkpointing requires that we make sure that there is no in-flight data inside the high-speed interface between the emulator and the testbench at the time of checkpointing. In the case that a checkpoint is taken without flushing the in-flight data, those transactions will be lost at the time of restoring from the checkpoint, thus resulting both in incorrect hardware state and incorrect state on the testbench side. Figure 7. Flowchart for Checkpoint Algorithm The following is the integrated algorithm for checkpointing of an emulation job. These steps are also depicted graphically in Figure 7. 1) A Checkpoint Request is received by the testbench either through an external utility such as dmtcp_command or through a user-exposed API, ScheduleCheckpoint, made by testbench itself. The request is sent to the emulator in order to freeze the running design. This will stop both the user design clocks and the simulation time itself. 2) Once a design is frozen, additional transactions from the hardware side will no longer be generated. At this point the data in flight inside the link is flushed until all of them have been processed and the emulator reaches a quiescent state. 3) When the emulator has reached a quiescent state, the system initiates the checkpoint of the emulator model by using the checkpoint technology native to the emulator. This will store the current design state to disk. 4) The system then disconnects from the emulator and makes sure that all emulator-related processes are terminated. This step will ensure that any external connections not running under DMTCP are removed from consideration. For example, there may be connections to a licensing server, to some waveform dump servers, and so on. This also reduces the overall checkpoint time by freeing up memory used by these external connections that the binary checkpointing procedure would otherwise have to save, as described in the next step. Further, checkpoints taken this way are independent of which specific emulator the session was running on, and this makes it easy to relocate saved emulation jobs to other emulators. 5) Next, the system initiates DMTCP-based checkpointing on the testbench side. This involves calling dmtcp_checkpoint, a part of the DMTCP API. Here, one writes an emulation-specific external plugin for DMTCP, which will specify which files must be checkpointed. The DMTCP plugin is specific to the emulator and testbench infrastructure, and must also specify the path to the checkpoint database, where DMTCP checkpoint image files are saved alongside the hardware database, as a consolidated database within the user specified path. . DMTCP also allows a user to have certain processes be explicitly excluded from checkpointing. This might be required for the case where processes have been spawned from an external library linked into the user testbench. Those processes are not required as part of a correct checkpoint state. And further, attempting to save such superfluous processes leads to other issues when restoring from a checkpoint if those processes were communicating with external processes that were not running under DMTCP. The details of DMTCP external plugins can be found in [2, 3]. 6) After the invocation of dmtcp_checkpoint returns, we can choose either to exit the current emulation or to resume the current run. 7) After resuming from a checkpoint, the following steps are taken: ● Re-connect to same emulator and configure the same design again. ● Restart the tool-specific processes and re-connect to servers from which they exited in step (4). This step is isolated to the emulation tool’s internal workings, and does not require the collaboration of DMTCP. ● Perform a hardware design restore from the same checkpoint database and start the design clocks. ● Note that after being restored from a checkpoint, the testbench side resumes in a correct state at the end of this procedure, and so nothing more is required on the testbench side. B. Restore/Restart The DMTCP package dumps a restart script at the time of checkpoint. This script takes care of restarting the entire testbench tree of processes. This script also takes care of restarting processes that were on remote machines. After restart, the system will “wake up” in step (6) in the checkpoint sequence above, as if we have just returned from the call to dmtcp_checkpoint. So the remaining steps to restart are the same as those described in step (7) above. Figure 8. Flowchart for Restore The following is the algorithm for the restart/resume. These steps are also depicted graphically in Figure 8. 1) Use the restart script generated by DMTCP that relies on the checkpoint database (the checkpoint image files) in order to bring the whole testbench tree of processes up and running. 2) After DMTCP’s restore/restart, we return from the call to dmtcp_checkpoint. The next steps bring the HDL side up and fork any tool-specific processes. 3) The system then re-connects the emulator resource and downloads the design. 4) The system then restarts the tool-specific processes and re-connects to external servers such as license servers, waveform collection servers, etc. This step is completely isolated from the internal workings of the emulator tool. 5) The system then performs the hardware design restore using the same checkpoint database, and it starts the design clocks. This is the last step in successfully restoring the emulation. V. CASE STUDY: SKIPPING THE OS BOOT IN AN OEM COMPANY’S SOC VALIDATION ENVIRONMENT For this case study, the SoC validation environment instantiates a SoC containing a CPU, Memory Subsystem, Switching Fabric, and peripherals. The SoC is modeled in a hybrid environment whereby part of the SoC is modeled on the workstation and part of the SoC is modeled in the emulator, and the Switching Fabric is the bridge between the models. Many of the SoC validation use cases require firstly booting an operating system (OS) in order to run the applications that are being validated. The boot of the OS takes on the order of hours to days. Often the applications that are being validated execute in a fraction of the time that it takes to boot the OS. This means that only a fraction of the emulation time was used to validate the application and the larger portion of the time is spent booting the OS in order to be able to run the application. Thus the overall boot time has an important impact not only on how many applications can be run per user per day, but also, from an emulation efficiency standpoint, how much emulation time is spent just getting the OS booted versus running the applications that are used to validate the SoC and/or the application. The ideal scenario would be to eliminate the time it takes to boot the OS. A solution close to the ideal scenario is to checkpoint the SoC validation environment after the boot of the OS. This OS boot can then be delivered as part of a checkpoint image that is bundled with the rest of the SoC validation environment. The checkpoint of the hardware can be taken by technology native to the emulator. The complexity is in the checkpointing of the part of the SoC validation environment that is executing on the workstation. There were two early attempts to checkpoint, before settling on DMTCP as the preferred solution. A first attempt at checkpointing, prior to the use of DMTCP, was to capture all of the stimulus from the hardware during the OS boot along with a checkpoint of the hardware, and then to restore the OS boot using the stimulus. This stimulus was replayed into the software test bench to re-establish the state of the software, and then finally restore the state of the emulator using the hardware checkpoint. This method worked, except it had two notable drawbacks: (1) Depending on how much stimulus needed to be captured, the size of the replay database could become quite large. (2) The time it took the software testbench to execute, controlled the time it took to perform the restoration of the software testbench. A second attempt at checkpointing prior to employing DMTCP was to leverage the Boost C++ libraries to make each of the software components of the SoC validation environment checkpoint-able. This method worked except that it had a major drawback in that each SoC validation software component had to be developed with checkpointing in mind and if there was just one component that didn¹t support checkpointing or did the checkpointing incorrectly, the SoC validation environment was not checkpoint-able. Hence, the ideal solution would be to transparently checkpoint the software in the same way as we checkpoint the hardware. The DMTCP-based approach was able to overcome the limitations of these first two attempts by transparently checkpointing the software on the workstation, which includes the part of the SoC modeled on the workstation, the software testbench, and the emulation software. The checkpoint is taken without concern for how the software has been modeled and also without concern for the speed at which the software testbench executes. This resulted in making an “OS boot” checkpoint available to the users along with the SoC verification environment. This allows those users to restore the checkpoint in less than 5 minutes, and to then to run their applications for SoC validation in an environment after the OS boot. Now, users requiring this use case can focus their emulation time on running their application, and skipping the lengthy OS boot time. The DMTCP-based approach has accelerated the time to run an application by close to a factor of two. Additionally, it has freed up the emulation time that would have been spent in “OS boot”, thus saving many hours of emulation time. In addition, the DMTCP approach also saves the state of the emulation runtime software itself. This feature provides added value, as compared to the two earlier checkpointing approaches. The checkpoint-restore flow can now set up to address additional aspects of the emulation runtime environment, such as triggers, which are important for debugging in the case of an exception. This enables the designer to create an environment closer to a “turnkey solution”, in which the end user no longer has to remember to load the trigger prior to starting the run of their application. First use case of DMTCP at an OEM company was on a regression suite consisting of 40 jobs. The 40 jobs had a similar profile in that they required around 1 hour to boot the OS and then 1 hour of execution of test content. DMTCP was used to create a checkpoint just after the boot of the OS. This checkpoint then becomes part of the collateral of that database. Any future user of that database and software configuration can restore the checkpoint rather than re-running the boot of the OS. The restoration of database using the checkpoint takes around 5 minutes. That is a time savings of 55 minutes per job for this regression. As a reminder, this environment is a hybrid environment and pending the configuration of whether the CPU is in software or RTL and also the type of OS can greatly impact the ""OS boot"" time from an hour to days. For this regression the 40 jobs were able to run in around 22 hours versus previously they would have taken 40 hour. Job throughput was increased close to 2x. This results not only in a substantial time savings but also a substantial cost savings. Figure 9. Regression Suite Emulation Time Comparison Figure 9 is highlighting the changes introduced by adding DMTCP into this use case; the following points are related to the numbers in the figure 9. 1) Checkpoint is created for OS boot as part of preparing the database for users. 2) Restoring OS boot from checkpoint saves 55 minutes for each job. 3) First job is completed after 1.1 hours with DMTCP versus 2 hours without DMTCP. 4) Full regression is completed after 22.9 hours with DMTCP versus 40 hours without DMTCP. During the integration of DMTCP with the emulation and SoC validation environment, we faced several challenges: (1) Very large read-only files were being saved as part of the checkpoint. This had an impact on both checkpoint/restore time as well as the memory footprint on disk. This was solved by having the DMTCP Emulation plugin detect and decide not to checkpoint such read-only files. The tool-specific file list was written into the DMTCP plugin to identify just those files that needed to be checkpointed. (2) Checkpoints were not portable to another site, due to some file paths that were preserved as part of the checkpoint. This was solved by using the existing file path virtualization plugin of DMTCP, allowing these paths to be changed at restore time. Limitations found when deploying DMTCP 1) Some use cases have a remote process connected via TCP on Windows machine. Additional work would be required to support this kind of use case both within the DMTCP community as well as in the testbench infrastructure. 2) Some use cases require changing the initial state of the environment which is part of the DMTCP checkpoint. For instance, if you had a SoC that had a programmable number of DIMMs and the number of DIMMs was changing per test you wouldn't be able to re-use a single checkpoint. DMTCP was found to be easy to integrate, and it required minimal changes to emulation environment. This has demonstrated the success of this approach toward OS-based use case validation during emulation. VI. FUTURE WORK We intend to work on developing preemptive capabilities for emulation jobs in a workload management system such as LSF. A case study in this environment is needed in order to discover the practical challenges thereof, and to help deploy this technology for more flexible job scheduling management. Finally, verification of a network switch presents an additional interesting case study for the future. In this scenario, a virtual machine is often required, so that simulated Ethernet traffic can be injected by the virtual machine into the environment for verification test coverage. This makes transparent checkpointing on the testbench side more difficult, since even though the virtual machine can be modified to inject Ethernet traffic, the virtual machine snapshot facility is difficult to modify, and so the state of the Ethernet traffic generator will not be checkpointed. On restore, some steps in the state diagram for Ethernet packets may be lost. As part of future work, it is proposed to use the ability of DMTCP to checkpoint a virtual machine from the outside. DMTCP has the ability to carry out a snapshot from the outside for the case of a QEMU virtual machine over KVM [4]. That same work [4] also presents DMTCP's ability to checkpoint a network of virtual machines. This latter case makes possible verification for end-to-end Ethernet test coverage between two virtual machines. VII. CONCLUSION This paper describes the approach to transparently checkpoint/restore emulation jobs and various key benefits it brings along with it. This integration was successfully tried in an OEM company’s SOC validation environment, which not only reduced total regression time but also increased Emulator efficiency. Emulation time is precious and any saving of this time directly affects one’s total verification cost. Experimental results have shown that this approach, when integrated with job management system, has increased the emulator utilization and has also increased the productivity of the verification engineers by providing them with a window to look back in time. The integration has also been successfully tried for a variety of software testbenches including C/C++/SystemC, and a SystemVerilog testbench running on a simulator. These testbenches can have multiple threads or multiple processes spread across different machines.",1884

Venkatadri et al., ""Privacy Risks with Facebook's PII-Based Targeting: Auditing a Data Broker's Advertising Interface,"" 2018 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), San Francisco, CA, 2018, pp. 89-107.","—Sites like Facebook and Google now serve as de facto data brokers, aggregating data on users for the purpose of implementing powerful advertising platforms. Historically, these services allowed advertisers to select which users see their ads via targeting attributes. Recently, most advertising platforms have begun allowing advertisers to target users directly by uploading the personal information of the users who they wish to advertise to (e.g., their names, email addresses, phone numbers, etc.); these services are often known as custom audiences. Custom audiences effectively represent powerful linking mechanisms, allowing advertisers to leverage any PII (e.g., from customer data, public records, etc.) to target users. In this paper, we focus on Facebook’s custom audience implementation and demonstrate attacks that allow an adversary to exploit the interface to infer users’ PII as well as to infer their activity. Speciﬁcally, we show how the adversary can infer users’ full phone numbers knowing just their email address, determine whether a particular user visited a website, and de-anonymize all the visitors to a website by inferring their phone numbers en masse. These attacks can be conducted without any interaction with the victim(s), cannot be detected by the victim(s), and do not require the adversary to spend money or actually place an ad. We propose a simple and effective ﬁx to the attacks based on reworking the way Facebook de-duplicates uploaded information. Facebook’s security team acknowledged the vulnerability and has put into place a ﬁx that is a variant of the ﬁx we propose. Overall, our results indicate that advertising platforms need to carefully consider the privacy implications of their interfaces.The vast amounts of user data that social networking services have collected is now utilized by their advertising platforms to allow advertisers to target users via their PII. In this paper, we have shown how the inclusion of PII-based targeting opens up new privacy leaks in advertising platforms. By giving advertisers ﬁne-grained control over the set of users targeted, and by providing them with coarse-grained statistics of audience sizes, the platforms open themselves to powerful attacks that can let an adversary learn private information about users. While we have proposed a solution to the attacks we uncovered, our work shows that platforms need to carefully audit their interfaces when introducing PII-based targeting.",1887

While recent advancements in data augmentation have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, they often rely on computationally expensive and dynamic algorithms. Unfortunately, current system optimiza- tions, primarily designed to leverage CPUs, cannot effectively sup- port these methods due to costs and limited resource availability. To address these issues, we introduce FusionFlow, a system that cooperatively utilizes both CPUs and GPUs to accelerate the data preprocessing stage of DL training that runs the data augmentation algorithm. FusionFlow orchestrates data preprocessing tasks across CPUs and GPUs while minimizing interference with GPU-based model training. In doing so, it effectively mitigates the risk of GPU memory overflow by managing memory allocations of the tasks within the GPU-wide free space. Furthermore, FusionFlow provides a dynamic scheduling strategy for tasks with varying computational demands and reallocates compute resources on the fly to enhance training throughput for both single and multi-GPU DL jobs. Our evaluations show that FusionFlow outperforms existing CPU-based methods by 16–285% in single-machine scenarios and, to achieve similar training speeds, requires 50–60% fewer CPUs compared to utilizing scalable compute resources from external servers.
