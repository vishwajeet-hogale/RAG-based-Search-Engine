National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF),"Through National Science Foundation funding, Khoury is leading a new national-scale computing infrastructure project that will enable researchers to delve into the mysteries of large-scale AI systems and address the gulf between the efficacy of machine learning and scientists’ ability to explain it. This work will help unlock the mysteries of these “black boxes” and ensure this powerful technology is used safely and effectively.",https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/national-deep-inference-fabric-ndif-to-advance-the-science-of-ai-address-gap-between-machine-learning-and-scientists-ability-to-explain-it/,2111
Reinventing the future of work for workers,"Researchers at Khoury’s Civic AI Lab are working to bring better computer tools to serve the workers in the gig economy (estimated to be 60% of the workforce by 2027). These workers are typically managed by platforms that give companies constant surveillance data and can disempower workers. Khoury College is building tools, using methodologies like value-sensitive design (VS), to give workers power over their own data and means to fight back against the surveillance and advance equitable working conditions.",https://civicai.khoury.northeastern.edu,2112
Enabling more secure search,"How could we do a search without the site knowing what we are searching for? Khoury faculty are researching how to encrypt data, and still work within it, while not providing information to third parties. This has the potential to provide secure search and other computing functions, vastly increasing the privacy protections on the Internet with the potential that someday you could use a search engine that wouldn’t see — or be able to track — what you’re doing.",https://neucrypt.github.io,2113
Relational Agents Group,"Khoury researchers are building the next generation of relational agents, computer programs designed to build and maintain long-term relationships with users. Health is a key focus, and Khoury labs have created tools for health promotion, mental health counseling, and palliative care, among other topics.",http://relationalagents.com/index.html,2114
Creating new tools for mobility data science,"Modern applications create massive amounts of data about how people and objects move – from packages we order, GPS that guides our cars, or fitness trackers that map a walk or run. Such mobility data presents unique challenges for programs; Khoury researchers are collaborating on new tools to work with it while investigating ways to preserve privacy in mobility data sets and also integrate it with AI approaches.",,2115
