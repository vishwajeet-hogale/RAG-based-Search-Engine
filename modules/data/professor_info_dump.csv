In work with undergraduates, he created CHUCK, a robot that still needs some work, but will eventually beat its creator in a game of cornhole!",Artificial intelligence; Machine learning,"PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan; MS in Computer Science and Engineering, University of Michigan; BS in Computer Science, North Carolina State University","July 19th, 2022",Using domain knowledge in coevolution and reinforcement learning to simulate a logistics enterprise,https://doi.org/10.1145/3520304.3528990," Ying Zhao , Erik Hemberg, Nate Derbinsky, Gabino Mata, Una-May O'Reilly.
