Semi-streaming algorithms for dynamic streams were first obtained in the seminal work of Ahn, Guha, and McGregor in 2012, alongside the introduction of the graph sketching technique, which remains the de facto way of designing algorithms in this model and a highly popular technique for designing graph algorithms in general. We settle the pass complexity of approximating maximum matchings in dynamic streams via semistreaming algorithms by improving the state-of-the-art in both upper and lower bounds: • We present a randomized sketching based semi-streaming algorithm for O (1)-approximation of maximum matching in dynamic streams using O (log log n ) passes. The approximation ratio of this algorithm can be improved to (1 + ε ) for any fixed ε > 0 even on weighted graphs using standard techniques. This exponentially improves upon several O (log n ) pass algorithms developed for this problem since the introduction of the dynamic graph streaming model. • We prove that any semi-streaming algorithm (not only sketching based) for O (1)-approximation of maximum matching in dynamic streams requires Ω (log log n ) passes. This presents the first multi-pass lower bound for this problem, which is already also optimal, settling a longstanding open question in this area."

The current best bound is a (1/2 + ɛ 0 )- approximation for a small constant ɛ 0 > 0, due to recent works of Behnezhad [SODA’23] (ɛ 0 ~ 0.001) and Bhattacharya, Kiss, Saranurak, Wajc [SODA’23] (ɛ 0 ~ 0.006) who broke the long-standing 1/2-approximation barrier.

This allows us to obtain non-trivial albeit slight improvements over longstanding bounds for matchings in streaming and dynamic graphs. In particular, we establish the following results for n -vertex graphs: A deterministic single-pass streaming algorithm that finds a (1− o (1))-approximate matching in o ( n 2 ) bits of space. This constitutes the first single-pass algorithm for this problem in sublinear space that improves over the 1/2-approximation of the greedy algorithm. A randomized fully dynamic algorithm that with high probability maintains a (1− o (1))-approximate matching in o ( n ) worst-case update time per each edge insertion or deletion. The algorithm works even against an adaptive adversary. This is the first o ( n ) update-time dynamic algorithm with approximation guarantee arbitrarily close to one. Given the use of regularity lemma, the improvement obtained by our algorithms over trivial bounds is only by some (log * n ) Θ(1) factor. Nevertheless, in each case, they show that the “right” answer to the problem is not what is dictated by the previous bounds. Finally, in the streaming model, we also present a randomized (1− o (1))-approximation algorithm whose space can be upper bounded by the density of certain Ruzsa-Szemerédi (RS) graphs.

In this paper, we show that when the goal is to maintain just the size of the matching (and not its edge-set), then these bounds can indeed be improved. First, we give an algorithm that takes (polylog n ) update-time and maintains a .501-approximation (.585-approximation if the graph is bipartite). Second, we give an algorithm that maintains a (2/3 + Ω(1))-approximation in time for bipartite graphs. Our results build on new connections to sublinear time algorithms.

New Trade-Offs for Fully Dynamic Matching via Hierarchical EDCS SODA, 3529-3566. https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611977073.140","We study the maximum matching problem in fully dynamic graphs: a graph is undergoing both edge insertions and deletions, and the goal is to efficiently maintain a large matching after each edge update. This problem has received considerable attention in recent years. The known algorithms naturally exhibit a trade-off between the quality of the matching maintained (i.e., the approximation ratio) and the time needed per update. While several interesting results have been obtained, the optimal behavior of this trade-off remains largely unclear. Our main contribution is a new approach to designing fully dynamic approximate matching algorithms that in a unified manner not only (essentially) recovers all previously known trade-offs that were achieved via very different techniques, but reveals some new ones as well. Specifically, we introduce a generalization of the edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS) of Bernstein and Stein (2015) that we call the hierarchical EDCS (HEDCS). We also present a randomized algorithm for efficiently maintaining an HEDCS. In an m -edge graph with maximum degree Δ, for any integer k ≥ 0 that is essentially the number of levels of the hierarchy in HEDCS, our algorithm takes Õ (min{Δ 1/( k + 1) , m 1/(2 k +2) }) worst-case update-time and maintains an (almost) α ( k )-approximate matching where we show: These bounds recover all previous trade-offs known for dynamic matching in the literature up to logarithmic factors in the update-time. α (2) > .612 for bipartite graphs, and α (2) > .609 for general graphs.

(EC’21). Here, nodes on one side of the graph are given upfront, while at each time t, an online node and its edge weights are drawn from a time-dependent distribution. The optimal algorithm is PSPACE-hard to approximate within some universal constant. We refer to this optimal algorithm, which requires time to think (compute), as a philosopher, and refer to polynomial-time online approximations of the above as philosopher inequalities. The best known philosopher inequality for online matching yields a 0.652-approximation. In contrast, the best possible prophet inequality, or approximation of the optimum offline solution, is 0.5. Our main results are a 0.678-approximate algorithm and a 0.685-approximation for a vertex-weighted special case. Notably, both bounds exceed the 0.666-approximation of the offline optimum obtained by Tang, Wu, and Wu (STOC’22) for the vertex-weighted problem. Building on our algorithms and the recent black-box reduction of Banihashem et al. (SODA’24), we provide polytime (pricing-based) truthful mechanisms which 0.678-approximate the social welfare of the optimal online allocation for bipartite matching markets. Our online allocation algorithm relies on the classic pivotal sampling algorithm (Srinivasan FOCS’01, Gandhi et al. J.ACM’06), along with careful discarding to obtain strong negative correlations between offline nodes, while matching using the highest-value edges. Consequently, the analysis boils down to examining the distribution of a weighted sum X of negatively correlated Bernoulli variables, specifically lower bounding its mass below a threshold, 𝔼[min(1, X )], of possible independent interest. Interestingly, our bound relies on an imaginary invocation of pivotal sampling."

We focus on designing polynomial time approximation algorithms with respect to the online benchmark, which was first considered by Papadimitriou, Pollner, Saberi, and Wajc [EC'21]. In the vertex arrival version of the problem, the goal is to find an approximate max-weight matching of a given bipartite graph when the vertices in one part of the graph arrive online in a fixed order with independent chances of failure. Whenever a vertex arrives we should decide, irrevocably, whether to match it with one of its unmatched neighbors or leave it unmatched forever. There has been a long line of work designing approximation algorithms for different variants of this problem with respect to the offline benchmark (prophet). Papadimitriou et al., however, propose the alternative online benchmark and show that considering this new benchmark allows them to improve the 0.5 approximation ratio, which is the best ratio achievable with respect to the offline benchmark. They provide a 0.51-approximation algorithm which was later improved to 0.526 by Saberi and Wajc [ICALP'21]. The main contribution of this paper is designing a simple algorithm with a significantly improved approximation ratio of (1-1/e) for this problem. We also consider the edge arrival version in which, instead of vertices, edges of the graph arrive in an online fashion with independent chances of failure. Designing approximation algorithms for this problem has also been studied extensively with the best approximation ratio being 0.337 with respect to the offline benchmark. This paper, however, is the first to consider the online benchmark for the edge arrival version of the problem. For this problem, we provide a simple algorithm with an approximation ratio of 0.5 with respect to the online benchmark."

In contrast, our paper examines how task similarity and overparameterization jointly affect forgetting in an analyzable model. Specifically, we focus on two-task continual linear regression, where the second task is a random orthogonal transformation of an arbitrary first task (an abstraction of random permutation tasks). We derive an exact analytical expression for the expected forgetting - and uncover a nuanced pattern. In highly overparameterized models, intermediate task similarity causes the most forgetting. However, near the interpolation threshold, forgetting decreases monotonically with the expected task similarity. We validate our findings with linear regression on synthetic data, and with neural networks on established permutation task benchmarks."

Inspired by a long line of work in social choice and economics, the goal is to optimize the Nash social welfare instead of the total utility. Unfortunately previous algorithms either are not efficient or achieve sub-optimal regret in terms of the number of rounds. We propose a new efficient algorithm with lower regret than even previous inefficient ones. We also complement our efficient algorithm with an inefficient approach with regret that matches the lower bound for one agent. The experimental findings confirm the effectiveness of our efficient algorithm compared to the previous approaches."

We propose a new algorithmic framework, namely ProjUnit, for private mean estimation that yields algorithms that are computationally efficient, have low communication complexity, and incur optimal error up to a 1 + o ( 1 ) 1 + o ( 1 ) -factor. Our framework is deceptively simple: each randomizer projects its input to a random low-dimensional subspace and then runs an optimal algorithm such a PrivUnitG in the lower dimensional space. We analyze the error of the algorithm in terms of properties of the random projection ensemble, and study two instantiations.

Extensive work has been done on privately maximizing submodular functions in the general case when the function depends upon the private data of individuals. However, when the size of the data stream drawn from the domain of the objective function is large or arrives very fast, one must privately optimize the objective within the constraints of the streaming setting. We establish fundamental differentially private baselines for this problem and then derive better trade-offs between privacy and utility for the special case of decomposable submodular functions. A submodular function is decomposable when it can be written as a sum of submodular functions; this structure arises naturally when each summand function models the utility of an individual and the goal is to study the total utility of the whole population as in the well-known Combinatorial Public Projects Problem.

Our algorithms automatically adapt to unknown problem parameters such as the smoothness and the norm of the operator, and the variance of the stochastic evaluation oracle. We show that our algorithms are universal and simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates in the non-smooth, smooth, and stochastic settings. The convergence guarantees of our algorithms improve over existing adaptive methods and match the optimal non-adaptive algorithms. Additionally, prior works require that the optimization domain is bounded. In this work, we remove this restriction and give algorithms for unbounded domains that are adaptive and universal. Our general proof techniques can be used for many variants of the algorithm using one or two operator evaluations per iteration. The classical methods based on the ExtraGradient/MirrorProx algorithm require two operator evaluations per iteration, which is the dominant factor in the running time in many settings."

In this work, we develop a new streaming algorithm for maximizing a monotone k-submodular function subject to a per-coordinate cardinality constraint attaining an approximation guarantee close to the state of the art guarantee in the offline setting. Though not typical for streaming algorithms, our streaming algorithm also readily applies to the online setting with free disposal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and enjoys fast running time and small number of function evaluations. Furthermore, its guarantee improves as the cardinality constraints get larger, which is especially suited for the large scale applications. For the special case of maximizing a submodular function with large budgets, our combinatorial algorithm matches the guarantee of the state-of-the-art continuous algorithm, which requires significantly more time and function evaluations."

In many practical settings this is a significant improvement over the O (n+k^2) computation cost that is achieved by the recent PI-RAPPOR algorithm (Feldman and Talwar; 2021). Our empirical evaluation shows a speedup of over 50x over PI-RAPPOR while using approximately 75x less memory.

While there has been abundant success in proving space lower bounds, there have been no non-trivial turnstile update time lower bounds.

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size."

It is used extensively in geometric settings and in the guise of so-called merge (or compaction) policies in big-data databases such as Google Bigtable and LevelDB (our focus). Previous theoretical work is based on worst-case analyses for uniform inputs — insertions of one item at a time and constant read rate. In practice, merge policies must not only handle batch insertions and varying read/write ratios, they can take advantage of such non-uniformity to reduce cost on a per-input basis. To model this, we initiate the study of data-structure dynamization through the lens of competitive analysis, via two new online set-cover problems. For each, the input is a sequence of disjoint sets of weighted items. The sets are revealed one at a time. The algorithm must respond to each with a set cover that covers all items revealed so far. It obtains the cover incrementally from the previous cover by adding one or more sets and optionally removing existing sets. For each new set the algorithm incurs build cost equal to the weight of the items in the set. In the first problem the objective is to minimize total build cost plus total query cost , where the algorithm incurs a query cost at each time t equal to the current cover size. In the second problem, the objective is to minimize the build cost while keeping the query cost from exceeding k (a given parameter) at any time. We give deterministic online algorithms for both variants, with competitive ratios of Θ(log∗ n ) and k , respectively. The latter ratio is optimal for the second variant."

""A better method to analyze blockchain consistency."" Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2018.","The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol. To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous. The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains: Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider; We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols; We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction ""confirmed""; We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system; We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore ""balancing""-attack. In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages. We hope our techniques enable authors of future blockchain proposals to provide a more rigorous analysis of their schemes."

In the gossip problem,ntokens are arbitrarily distributed among thennetwork nodes, and the goal is to disseminate all thentokens to every node. Our focus is on token-forwarding algorithms, which do not manipulate tokens in any way other than storing, copying, and forwarding them. Gossip can be completed in linear time in any static network, but a basic open question for dynamic networks is the existence of a distributed protocol that can do significantly better than an easily achievable bound ofO(n2)rounds.In previous work, it has been shown that under adaptive adversaries, every token forwarding algorithm requiresΩ(n2/logn)rounds. In this paper, we study oblivious adversaries, which differ from adaptive adversaries in one crucial aspect--- they are oblivious to random choices made by the protocol. We present anΩ~(n3/2)lower bound under an oblivious adversary for RANDDIFF, a natural algorithm in which neighbors exchange a token chosen uniformly at random from the difference of their token sets. We also present anΩ~(n4/3)bound under a stronger notion of oblivious adversary for symmetric knowledge-based algorithms. On the positive side, we present a centralized algorithm that completes gossip inO~(n3/2)rounds. We also show anO~(n5/3)upper bound for RANDDIFF in a restricted class of oblivious adversaries, which we call paths-respecting."

A user should be able to perform keyword searches over all the documents she has access to, including the ones that others shared with her. The contents of the documents, and the search queries, should remain private from the server. This setting was considered by Popa et al. (NSDI '14) who developed a new cryptographic primitive called Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (MKSE), together with an instantiation and an implementation within a system called Mylar, to address this goal. Unfortunately, Grubbs et al. (CCS '16) showed that the proposed MKSE definition fails to provide basic security guarantees, and that the Mylar system is susceptible to simple attacks. Most notably, if a malicious Alice colludes with the server and shares a document with an honest Bob then the privacy of all of Bob's search queries is lost. In this work we revisit the notion of MKSE and propose a new strengthened definition that rules out the above attacks. We then construct MKSE schemes meeting our definition. We first give a simple and efficient construction using only pseudorandom functions. This construction achieves our strong security definition at the cost of increasing the server storage overhead relative to Mylar, essentially replicating the document each time it is shared. We also show that high server storage overhead is not inherent, by giving an alternate (albeit impractical) construction that manages to avoid it using obfuscation. BibTeX Copy to clipboard"

We call this problem Slot-Heterogenous Paging.We parameterize the problem by specifying a familyS⊆2[k]of requestable slot sets, and we establish bounds on the competitive ratio as a function of the cache sizekand familyS:- If all request sets are allowed (S=2[k]∖{∅}), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard \Paging (S={[k]}).- As a function of|S|andk, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at mostO(k2|S|)and at leastΩ(|S|−−−√).- For any laminar familySof heighth, the optimal ratios areO(hk)(deterministic) andO(h2logk)(randomized).- The special case of laminarSthat we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in.

Most previous works have focused on two extreme situations where any testing data point either is completely adversarial or always equally prefers the positive label. In this paper, we generalize both of these through a unified framework for strategic classification and introduce the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to capture the PAC-learnability in our general strategic setup. SVC provably generalizes the recent concept of adversarial VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by Cullina et al. (2018). We instantiate our framework for the fundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize: (1) the statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC; (2) it’s computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is always upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension. This characterization also strictly generalizes the AVC bound for linear classifiers in (Cullina et al., 2018)."

Specifically, given nodes labelled with search query text, we want to predict links to related queries that share products. Experiments with a range of deep neural architectures show that simple feedforward networks with an attention mechanism perform best for learning embeddings. The simplicity of these models allows us to explain the performance of attention.We propose an analytically tractable model of query generation, AttEST, that views both products and the query text as vectors embedded in a latent space. We prove (and empirically validate) that the point-wise mutual information (PMI) matrix of the AttEST query text embeddings displays a low-rank behavior analogous to that observed in word embeddings. This low-rank property allows us to derive a loss function that maximizes the mutual information between related queries which is used to train an attention network to learn query embeddings. This AttEST network beats traditional memory-based LSTM architectures by over 20% on F-1 score. We justify this out-performance by showing that the weights from the attention mechanism correlate strongly with the weights of the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for the product vectors, and conclude that attention plays an important role in variance reduction."

Unfortunately, the costs of distributing this content are largely incurred by web site operators; popular web sites are required to make substantial monetary investments in serving infrastructure or cloud computing resources---or must pay other organizations (e.g., content distribution networks)---to help serve content. Previous approaches to offloading some of the distribution costs onto end users have relied on client-side software or web browser plug-ins, providing poor user incentives and dramatically limiting their scope in practice. In this paper, we present Maygh, a system that builds a content distribution network from client web browsers, without the need for additional plug-ins or client-side software. The result is an organically scalable system that distributes the cost of serving web content across the users of a web site. Through simulations based on real-world access logs from Etsy (a large e-commerce web site that is the 50th most popular web site in the U.S.), microbenchmarks, and a small-scale deployment, we demonstrate that Maygh provides substantial savings to site operators, imposes only modest costs on clients, and can be deployed on the web sites and browsers of today. In fact, if Maygh was deployed to Etsy, it would reduce network bandwidth due to static content by 75% and require only a single coordinating server."

Our framework is based on using a private approximate risk minimizer to ""warm start"" another private algorithm for finding stationary points. We use this framework to obtain improved, and sometimes optimal, rates for several classes of non-convex loss functions. First, we obtain improved rates for finding stationary points of smooth non-convex empirical loss functions. Second, we specialize to quasar-convex functions, which generalize star-convex functions and arise in learning dynamical systems and training some neural nets. We achieve the optimal rate for this class. Third, we give an optimal algorithm for finding stationary points of functions satisfying the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition. For example, over-parameterized neural networks often satisfy this condition. Fourth, we provide new state-of-the-art rates for stationary points of non-convex population loss functions. Fifth, we obtain improved rates for non-convex generalized linear models. A modification of our algorithm achieves nearly the same rates for second-order stationary points of functions with Lipschitz Hessian, improving over the previous state-of-the-art for each of the above problems.

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation."

Specifically, we characterize this sample complexity up to constant factors in terms of the structure ofPandQand the privacy levelε, and show that this sample complexity is achieved by a certain randomized and clamped variant of the log-likelihood ratio test. Our result is an analogue of the classical Neyman-Pearson lemma in the setting of private hypothesis testing. We also give an application of our result to the private change-point detection. Our characterization applies more generally to hypothesis tests satisfying essentially any notion of algorithmic stability, which is known to imply strong generalization bounds in adaptive data analysis, and thus our results have applications even when privacy is not a primary concern."

Specifically, we look at how best to design differentially private protocols in a distributed setting, where each user holds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered two models: the ""central"" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear, which allows greater accuracy; and the ""local"" model, in which users individually randomize their data, and need not trust the server, but accuracy is limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central model without a trusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which limits scalability.In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for distributed differentially private algorithms, which lies between the local and central models. This simple-to-implement model, a special case of the ESA framework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an anonymous channel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum queries, we show that this model provides the power of the central model while avoiding the need to trust a central server and the complexity of cryptographic secure function evaluation. More generally, we give evidence that the power of the shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local models: for a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a widely studied selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity than do central-model protocols."

Variants of this task arise naturally in fundamental problems like feature selection and hypothesis testing, and also as subroutines for many sophisticated differentially private algorithms.The standard approaches to these tasks---repeated use of the exponential mechanism or the sparse vector technique---approximately solve this problem given a dataset ofn=O(k−−√logd)samples. We provide a tight lower bound for some very simple variants of the private selection problem. Our lower bound shows that a sample of sizen=Ω(k−−√logd)is required even to achieve a very minimal accuracy guarantee.Our results are based on an extension of the fingerprinting method to sparse selection problems. Previously, the fingerprinting method has been used to provide tight lower bounds for answering an entire set ofdqueries, but often only some much smaller set ofkqueries are relevant. Our extension allows us to prove lower bounds that depend on both the number of relevant queries and the total number of queries."

A statistical query asks for the expectation of a predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical query is accurate if it is ""close"" to the correct expectation over the distribution. This question was recently studied by Dwork et al., who showed how to answerΩ~(n2)queries efficiently, and also by Hardt and Ullman, who showed that answeringO~(n3)queries is hard. We close the gap between the two bounds and show that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient algorithm that, givennsamples from an unknown distribution, can give valid answers toO(n2)adaptively chosen statistical queries. An implication of our results is that computationally efficient algorithms for answering arbitrary, adaptively chosen statistical queries may as well be differentially private.We obtain our results using a new connection between the problem of answering adaptively chosen statistical queries and a combinatorial object called an interactive fingerprinting code. In order to optimize our hardness result, we give a new Fourier-analytic approach to analyzing fingerprinting codes that is simpler, more flexible, and yields better parameters than previous constructions."

First, they do not apply to machines equipped with random-access memory, also known as direct-access memory, even though this feature is critical in basic algorithms. Second, they incur a quadratic blow-up in parameters, even though the distinction between, say, linear and quadratic time is often as critical as the one between polynomial and exponential. But the landmark result of a sequence of works overcomes both these drawbacks simultaneously! \cite{HennieS66,Schnorr78,PippengerF79,Cook88,GurevichS89,Robson91} The proof of this result is simplified by Van Melkebeek in \cite[\S 2.3.1]{Melkebeek06}.

In particular, we show (under a mild additional assumption) how to convert a BARG that generates proofs of length poly ( m )· k 1−є , where m is the length of a single instance and k is the number of instances being batched, into one that generates proofs of length poly ( m , log k ), which is the gold standard for succinctness of BARG s. By prior work, such BARG s imply the existence of SNARG s for deterministic time T computation with succinctness poly (log T ). Our result reduces the long-standing challenge of building publicly-verifiable delegation schemes to a much easier problem: building a batch argument system that beats the trivial construction. It also immediately implies new constructions of BARG s and SNARG s with polylogarithmic succinctness based on either bilinear maps or a combination of the DDH and QR assumptions. Along the way, we prove an equivalence between BARG s and a new notion of SNARG s for (deterministic) RAM computations that we call “ flexible RAM SNARG s with partial input soundness .” This is the first demonstration that SNARG s for deterministic computation (of any kind) imply BARG s. Our RAM SNARG notion is of independent interest and has already been used in a recent work on constructing rate-1 BARG s (Devadas et. ‍al. FOCS 2022)."

This paper considers predicting multiple node labeling functions on graphs simultaneously and revisits this problem from a multitask learning perspective. For a concrete example, consider overlapping community detection: each community membership is a binary node classification task. Due to complex overlapping patterns, we find that negative transfer is prevalent when we apply naive multitask learning to multiple community detection, as task relationships are highly nonlinear across different node labeling. To address the challenge, we develop an algorithm to cluster tasks into groups based on a higher-order task affinity measure. We then fit a multitask model on each task group, resulting in a boosting procedure on top of the baseline model. We estimate the higher-order task affinity measure between two tasks as the prediction loss of one task in the presence of another task and a random subset of other tasks. Then, we use spectral clustering on the affinity score matrix to identify task grouping. We design several speedup techniques to compute the higher-order affinity scores efficiently and show that they can predict negative transfers more accurately than pairwise task affinities. We validate our procedure using various community detection and molecular graph prediction data sets, showing favorable results compared with existing methods. Lastly, we provide a theoretical analysis to show that under a planted block model of tasks on graphs, our affinity scores can provably separate tasks into groups."

We investigate generalization properties of fine-tuning to understand the problem of overfitting, which often happens in practice. Previous works have shown that constraining the distance from the initialization of fine-tuning improves generalization. Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation, we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures. For example, on six image classification tasks whose training labels are generated with programmatic labeling, we show a 3.26% accuracy improvement over prior methods. Meanwhile, the Hessian distance measure of the fine-tuned network using our algorithm decreases by six times more than existing approaches."

Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on correlations between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor performance on data groups without these correlations. This is challenging to address when the spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To improve worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training attribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach to directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM models can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a trained ERM model’s outputs to identify samples with the same class but dissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive learning to learn similar representations for these samples. To support CNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a representation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe that worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the alignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class’s worst-group vs. average error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss drastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average absolute lift. CNC is also competitive with oracle methods that require group labels."

When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size of the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and ""memorizing"" the training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling---the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text data sets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task. When the target data set includes noisy labels, our approach outperforms baseline methods by 3.56% on average in two noisy settings."

Sharp Bias-variance Tradeoffs of Hard Parameter Sharing in High-dimensional Linear Regression. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11750.","The problem of learning one task with samples from another task has received much interest recently. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: when is combining data from two tasks better than learning one task alone? Intuitively, the transfer effect from one task to another task depends on dataset shifts such as sample sizes and covariance matrices. However, quantifying such a transfer effect is challenging since we need to compare the risks between joint learning and single-task learning, and the comparative advantage of one over the other depends on the exact kind of dataset shift between both tasks. This paper uses random matrix theory to tackle this challenge in a linear regression setting with two tasks. We give precise asymptotics about the excess risks of some commonly used estimators in the high-dimensional regime, when the sample sizes increase proportionally with the feature dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics is provided as a function of the sample sizes and covariate/model shifts, which can be used to study transfer effects: In a random-effects model, we give conditions to determine positive and negative transfers between learning two tasks versus single-task learning; the conditions reveal intricate relations between dataset shifts and transfer effects. Simulations justify the validity of the asymptotics in finite dimensions. Our analysis examines several functions of two different sample covariance matrices, revealing some estimates that generalize classical results in the random matrix theory literature, which may be of independent interest."

Abstract The ingrained principles of fairness in a dialogue system’s decision-making process and generated responses are crucial for user engagement, satisfaction, and task achievement. Absence of equitable and inclusive principles can hinder the formation of common ground, which in turn negatively impacts the overall performance of the system. For example, misusing pronouns in a user interaction may cause ambiguity about the intended subject. Yet, there is no comprehensive study of equitable text generation in dialogue. Aptly, in this work, we use theories of computational learning to study this problem. We provide formal definitions of equity in text generation, and further, prove formal connections between learning human-likeness and learning equity: algorithms for improving equity ultimately reduce to algorithms for improving human-likeness (on augmented data). With this insight, we also formulate reasonable conditions under which text generation algorithms can learn to generate equitable text without any modifications to the biased training data on which they learn. To exemplify our theory in practice, we look at a group of algorithms for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game and, using this example, test our theory empirically. Our theory accurately predicts relative-performance of multiple algorithms in generating equitable text as measured by both human and automated evaluation."

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return."

Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across λ λ -values in an off-policy control task."

State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are related to the effectiveness of different types of critics."

Abstract Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups."

In this work we ask: Why and how does this additional training signal help in model distillation? We perform ablations to interrogate this, and report some potentially surprising results. Specifically: (1) Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) realizes consistently better downstream performance -- this means that no student ""reasoning"" is necessary at test time to realize gains. (2) When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements; performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens, for example.

We find that hyper-parameter tuning can improve this baseline by 9%. We examined 576 combinations of hyper-parameters: learning rate, batch size, epochs and date range of training data. Reasonable settings of learning rate and batch size produce better results than poor settings. Date range is less conclusive. Balancing the date range of the training data to match the benchmark ought to improve performance, but the differences are relatively small. Optimal settings of learning rate and batch size are much better than poor settings, but optimal settings of date range are not that different from poor settings of date range. Finally, we end with concerns about reproducibility. Of the 576 experiments, 10% produced F1 performance above baseline. It is common practice in the literature to run many experiments and report the best, but doing so may be risky, especially given the sensitive nature of Suicide Ideation Detection."

We address issues inherent to evaluating generative approaches to RE by doing human evaluations, in lieu of relying on exact matching.

Apparent subgroup performance varies substantially for seeds that yield similar overall performance, although there is no evidence of a trade-off between overall and subgroup performance. However, we also find that the small sample sizes inherent to looking at intersections of minority groups and somewhat rare conditions limit our ability to accurately estimate disparities. Further, we find that jointly optimizing for high overall performance and low disparities does not yield statistically significant improvements. Our results suggest that fairness work using MIMIC-III should carefully account for variations in apparent differences that may arise from stochasticity and small sample sizes."

Through an analysis of over 600,000 tweets from over 256,000 unique users, we examine online #MeToo conversations across gender and racial/ethnic identities and the topics that each demographic emphasized. We found that tweets authored by white women were overrepresented in the movement compared to other demographics, aligning with criticism of unequal representation.

PLANT also shows remarkable data efficiency in few-shot scenarios, achieving precision comparable to traditional models with significantly less data. These results are achieved through key technical innovations: leveraging a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model as the planted attention layer, integrating mutual-information gain to enhance attention, introducing an inattention mechanism, and implementing a stateful-decoder to maintain context. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the importance of these contributions in realizing the performance gains."

Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task."

It can accommodate data that embeddings from features or distances cannot, but is a more difficult problem. We propose a novel landmark-based method as a partial solution. At small to medium scales, we present a novel combination of existing methods with some new theoretical justification. For very large values of n optimizing over an entire embedding breaks down, so we propose a novel method which first embeds a subset of m << n objects and then embeds the remaining objects independently and in parallel. We prove a distance error bound for our method in terms of m and that it has O(dn log m) time complexity, and show empirically that it is able to produce high quality embeddings in a fraction of the time needed for any published method."

For each assessor, we model assessor quality and bias in the form of Gaussian distributed class conditionals of relevance grades. For each document, we model true relevance and difficulty as continuous variables. We estimate all parameters from crowdsourced data, demonstrating better inference of relevance as well as realistic models for both documents and assessors. A document-pair likelihood model works best, and it is extended to pairwise learning to rank. Utilizing more information directly from the input data, it shows better performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches for learning to rank from crowdsourced assessments.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM."

To test this, we measure linear approximation and causal intervention methods in GPT-J-6B to evaluate the degree to which individual hidden states in the network contain signal rich enough to predict future hidden states and, ultimately, token outputs. We find that, at some layers, we can approximate a model's output with more than 48% accuracy with respect to its prediction of subsequent tokens through a single hidden state.

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing.

In our experience, some universities try to use a ""watered-down"" version of the tenure-track promotion standards with the intent of uniformity. Other universities have created whole new processes, which may be better at capturing the differences in teaching-track positions, but also can create a ""second-class citizen"" status for the teaching-track faculty members. For this panel, we will bring together teaching-track and tenured faculty who have been active in promotion committees, have written letters of support for teaching-track faculty, and have successfully guided junior faculty through the promotion process. Our goal is to shed light on the differing practices at various universities and help attendees understand how to best support junior teaching-track faculty."

The CoEv-Soar-RL uses reinforcement learning and coevolutionary algorithms to improve the functions of a logistics enterprise value chain. We address: (1) holistic prediction, optimization, and simulation for the logistics enterprise readiness; (2) the uncertainty and lack of data which require large-scale systematic what-if scenarios to simulate potential new and unknown situations. In this paper, we perform four experiments to investigate how to integrate prediction and simulation to modify a logistics enterprise's demand models and generate synthetic data based. We use general domain knowledge to design simple operators for the coevolutionary search algorithm that provide realistic solutions for the simulation of the logistic enterprise. In addition, to evaluate generated solutions we learn a surrogate model of a logistic enterprise environment from historical data with Soar reinforcement learning. From our experiments we discover, and verify with subject matter experts, novel realistic solutions for the logistic enterprise. These novel solutions perform better than the historical data and where only found when we include knowledge derived from the historical data in the co-evolutionary search."

Moreover, the features that belong to each group, and the important feature groups may vary per sample. But what do we mean by feature redundancy? In this paper, we formally define two types of redundancies using information theory: \textit{Representation} and \textit{Relevant redundancies}. We leverage these redundancies to design a formulation for instance-wise feature group discovery and reveal a theoretical guideline to help discover the appropriate number of groups. We approximate mutual information via a variational lower bound and learn the feature group and selector indicators with Gumbel-Softmax in optimizing our formulation. Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical claims. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and gene expression datasets show that our method discovers feature groups with high classification accuracies."

In an adversarial scenario, the graph may be manipulated to avoid scrutiny of certain nodes by the analyst. Robustness to such behaviour is an important consideration for data analysts in high-stakes scenarios such as cyber defense and counterterrorism. We find that, when the attacker has a sufficient budget, overlapping community detection methods outperform non-overlapping methods, often overwhelmingly so. Our extensible analytic framework enables network data analysts to take these attacks into account and use them to make better decisions about which nodes to focus on."

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for each and offer in-depth discussions for future research on hypergraph mining."

An adversary that can manipulate the graph structure could alter traffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing traffic to a toll road). This article presents the Force Path Cut problem, in which an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the shortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that the optimization version of this problem is APX-hard but introduce PATHATTACK , a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path. We derive a nonconvex optimization formulation for these problems and derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We demonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic networks, illustrating where the proposed algorithms provide the greatest improvement over baseline methods."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

Recent work has shown that a malicious actor can manipulate a graph to make traffic between two nodes of interest follow their target path. In this paper, we develop a defense against such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose heuristic solutions based on increasing edge weights along target paths in both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum settings. Relaxing some constraints of the original problem, we formulate a linear program for local optimization around a feasible point. We present defense results with both synthetic and real network datasets and show that these methods often reach the lower bound of the defender's cost."

However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. Causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding.

Authenticity and exclusion: social media recommendation algorithms and the dynamics of belonging in professional networks CoRR, abs/2407.08552. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.08552","Recent philosophical work has explored how the social identity of knowers influences how their contributions are received, assessed, and credited. However, a critical gap remains regarding the role of technology in mediating and enabling communication within today's epistemic communities. This paper addresses this gap by examining how social media platforms and their recommendation algorithms shape the professional visibility and opportunities of researchers from minority groups. Using agent-based simulations, we investigate this question with respect to components of a widely used recommendation algorithm, and uncover three key patterns: First, these algorithms disproportionately harm the professional visibility of researchers from minority groups, creating systemic patterns of exclusion. Second, within these minority groups, the algorithms result in greater visibility for users who more closely resemble the majority group, incentivizing assimilation at the cost of professional invisibility. Third, even for topics that strongly align with minority identities, content created by minority researchers is less visible to the majority than similar content produced by majority users. Importantly, these patterns emerge, even though individual engagement with professional content is independent of group identity.

More broadly, they call for a closer examination of the pervasive, but often neglected role of AI and data-driven technologies in shaping today's epistemic communities."

In this paper, we present a crowdsourcing vignette study designed to assess the impacts of two plausible factors on AI-informed decision-making. First, we examine homophily -- do people defer more to models that tend to agree with them? -- by manipulating the agreement during training between participants and the algorithmic tool. Second, we considered incentives -- how do people incorporate a (known) cost structure in the hybrid decision-making setting? -- by varying rewards associated with true positives vs. true negatives. Surprisingly, we found limited influence of either homophily and no evidence of incentive effects, despite participants performing similarly to previous studies. Higher levels of agreement between the participant and the AI tool yielded more confident predictions, but only when outcome feedback was absent. These results highlight the complexity of characterizing human-algorithm interactions, and suggest that findings from social psychology may require re-examination when humans interact with algorithms."

However, many of the critical domains motivating this work are characterized by competitive marketplaces with many decision makers. Realistically, we might expect only a subset of them to adopt any non-compulsory fairness-conscious policy, a situation that political philosophers call partial compliance. This possibility raises important questions: how does partial compliance and the consequent strategic behavior of decision subjects affect the allocation outcomes? If k% of employers were to voluntarily adopt a fairness-promoting intervention, should we expect k% progress (in aggregate) towards the benefits of universal adoption, or will the dynamics of partial compliance wash out the hoped-for benefits? How might adopting a global (versus local) perspective impact the conclusions of an auditor? In this paper, we propose a simple model of an employment market, leveraging simulation as a tool to explore the impact of both interaction effects and incentive effects on outcomes and auditing metrics. Our key findings are that at equilibrium: (1) partial compliance by k% of employers can result in far less than proportional (k%) progress towards the full compliance outcomes; (2) the gap is more severe when fair employers match global (vs local) statistics; (3) choices of local vs global statistics can paint dramatically different pictures of the performance vis-a-vis fairness desiderata of compliant versus non-compliant employers; (4) partial compliance based on local parity measures can induce extreme segregation.

Unfortunately, many social desiderata concerning consequential decisions, such as justice or fairness, have no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework. In the hopes of mitigating these problems, researchers have proposed a variety of metrics for quantifying deviations from various statistical parities that we might hope to observe in a fair world, offering a variety of algorithms that attempt to satisfy subsets of these parities or to trade off the degree to which they are satisfied against utility. In this paper, we connect this approach to fair machine learning to the literature on ideal and non-ideal methodological approaches in political philosophy. The ideal approach requires positing the principles according to which a just world would operate. In the most straightforward application of ideal theory, one supports a proposed policy by arguing that it closes a discrepancy between the real and ideal worlds. However, by failing to account for the mechanisms by which our non-ideal world arose, the responsibilities of various decision-makers, and the impacts of their actions, naive applications of ideal thinking can lead to misguided policies. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between the recent literature on fair machine learning and the ideal approach in political philosophy, and show that some recently uncovered shortcomings in proposed algorithms reflect broader troubles faced by the ideal approach. We work this analysis through for different formulations of fairness and conclude with a critical discussion of real-world impacts and directions for new research."

It is impossible to directly sample neighbors in feature space in a black box setting. Instead, we show that it is possible to use a smaller proxy model to approximately sample from the neighborhood.

Precisely, these models align disparate domains into a co-embedding space, achieving impressive zero-shot performance on multi-modal tasks (e.g., image-text retrieval, VQA). However, existing methods often rely on well-prepared data that less frequently contain noise and variability encountered in real-world scenarios, leading to severe performance drops in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This work first comprehensively analyzes the performance drop between in-distribution (ID) and OOD retrieval. Based on empirical observations, we introduce a novel approach, Evidential Language-Image Posterior (ELIP), to achieve robust alignment between web images and semantic knowledge across various OOD cases by leveraging evidential uncertainties. The proposed ELIP can be seamlessly integrated into general image-text contrastive learning frameworks, providing an efficient fine-tuning approach without exacerbating the need for additional data. To validate the effectiveness of ELIP, we systematically design a series of OOD cases (e.g., image distortion, spelling errors, and a combination of both) on two benchmark datasets to mimic noisy data in real-world web applications. Our experimental results demonstrate that ELIP improves the performance and robustness of mainstream pre-trained vision-language models facing OOD samples in image-text retrieval tasks."

The existing deep image super-resolution (SR) methods either focus on high fidelity with pixel-level objectives or high perception with generative models. The emergence of diffusion model paves a fresh way for image restoration, which has the potential to offer a brand-new solution for p-d trade-off. We experimentally observed that the perceptual quality and distortion change in an opposite direction with the increase of sampling steps. In light of this property, we propose an adaptive skip diffusion model (SkipDiff), which aims to achieve high-fidelity perceptual image SR with fewer sampling steps. Specifically, it decouples the sampling procedure into coarse skip approximation and fine skip refinement stages. A coarse-grained skip diffusion is first performed as a high-fidelity prior to obtaining a latent approximation of the full diffusion. Then, a fine-grained skip diffusion is followed to further refine the latent sample for promoting perception, where the fine time steps are adaptively learned by deep reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, this approach also enables faster sampling of diffusion model through skipping the intermediate denoising process to shorten the effective steps of the computation. Extensive experimental results show that our SkipDiff achieves superior perceptual quality with plausible reconstruction accuracy and a faster sampling speed."

Most of these works mainly design elaborate structures to accelerate the inference of the transformer, where all feature tokens are propagated equally. However, they ignore the underlying characteristic of image content, i.e., various image regions have distinct restoration difficulties, especially for large images (2K-8K), failing to achieve adaptive inference. In this work, we propose an adaptive token sparsification transformer (AdaFormer) to speed up the model inference for image SR. Specifically, a texture-relevant sparse attention block with parallel global and local branches is introduced, aiming to integrate informative tokens from the global view instead of only in fixed local windows. Then, an early-exit strategy is designed to progressively halt tokens according to the token importance. To estimate the plausibility of each token, we adopt a lightweight confidence estimator, which is constrained by an uncertainty-guided loss to obtain a binary halting mask about the tokens. Experiments on large images have illustrated that our proposal reduces nearly 90% latency against SwinIR on Test8K, while maintaining a comparable performance."

In this study, we investigate the effect of hue variance in the context of video understanding and find this variance to be beneficial since static appearances are less important in videos that contain motion information. Based on this observation, we propose a data augmentation method for video understanding, named Motion Coherent Augmentation (MCA), that introduces appearance variation in videos and implicitly encourages the model to prioritize motion patterns, rather than static appearances. Concretely, we propose an operation SwapMix to efficiently modify the appearance of video samples, and introduce Variation Alignment (VA) to resolve the distribution shift caused by SwapMix, enforcing the model to learn appearance invariant representations. Comprehensive empirical evaluation across various architectures and different datasets solidly validates the effectiveness and generalization ability of MCA, and the application of VA in other augmentation methods.

However, most deep CNN-based SR models take massive computations to obtain high performance. Downsampling features for multi-resolution fusion is an efficient and effective way to improve the performance of visual recognition. Still, it is counter-intuitive in the SR task, which needs to project a low-resolution input to high-resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid Pixel-Unshuffled Network (HPUN) by introducing an efficient and effective downsampling module into the SR task. The network contains pixel-unshuffled downsampling and Self-Residual Depthwise Separable Convolutions. Specifically, we utilize pixel-unshuffle operation to downsample the input features and use grouped convolution to reduce the channels. Besides, we enhance the depthwise convolution's performance by adding the input feature to its output. The comparison findings demonstrate that, with fewer parameters and computational costs, our HPUN achieves and surpasses the state-of-the-art performance on SISR.

Existing works on layout representation often ignore element hierarchies, which is an important facet of layouts, and mainly rely on the spatial bounding boxes for feature extraction. This paper proposes a Spatial-Structural Hierarchical Auto-Encoder (SSH-AE) that learns hierarchical representation by treating a hierarchically annotated layout as a tree format. On the one side, we model SSH-AE from both spatial (semantic views) and structural (organization and relationships) perspectives, which are two complementary aspects to represent a layout. On the other side, the semantic/geometric properties are associated at multiple resolutions/granularities, naturally handling complex layouts. Our learned representations are used for effective layout search from both spatial and structural similarity perspectives. We also newly involve the tree-edit distance (TED) as an evaluation metric to construct a comprehensive evaluation protocol for layout similarity assessment, which benefits a systematic and customized layout search. We further present a new dataset of POSTER layouts which we believe will be useful for future layout research. We show that our proposed SSH-AE outperforms the existing methods achieving state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. Code is available at github.com/yueb17/SSH-AE."

However, for video action recognition, the action of interest might only exist in arbitrary clips of untrimmed web videos, resulting in high label noises in the temporal space. To address this challenge, we introduce a new method for pre-training video action recognition models using queried web videos. Instead of trying to filter out potential noises, we propose to provide fine-grained supervision signals by defining the concept of Sub-Pseudo Label (SPL). Specifically, SPL spans out a new set of meaningful ""middle ground"" label space constructed by extrapolating the original weak labels during video querying and the prior knowledge distilled from a teacher model. Consequently, SPL provides enriched supervision for video models to learn better representations and improves data utilization efficiency of untrimmed videos. We validate the effectiveness of our method on four video action recognition datasets and a weakly-labeled image dataset. Experiments show that SPL outperforms several existing pre-training strategies and the learned representations lead to competitive results on several benchmarks."

To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement. Moreover, we curate five real-world protein-aptamer interaction datasets and show that the contact map predicted by FAFormer serves as a strong binding indicator for aptamer screening."

How can we automatically design functional enzymes? In this paper, we propose EnzyGen, an approach to learn a unified model to design enzymes across all functional families. Our key idea is to generate an enzyme's amino acid sequence and their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates based on functionally important sites and substrates corresponding to a desired catalytic function. These sites are automatically mined from enzyme databases. EnzyGen consists of a novel interleaving network of attention and neighborhood equivariant layers, which captures both long-range correlation in an entire protein sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in 3D space. To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction loss. We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). Experimental results show that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity.

Its denoising network integrates an RNA inverse folding model and a pre-trained RosettaFold2NA network for generation of RNA sequences and structures. The integration of inverse folding in the structure denoising process allows us to simplify training by fixing the structure prediction network.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables.

However, due to the small watch screen, μEMA is better used to select among 2 to 5 multiple-choice answers versus allowing the collection of open-ended responses. We introduce an alternative and novel form of micro-interaction self-report using speech input - audio-μEMA- where a short beep or vibration cues participants to verbally report their behavioral states, allowing for open-ended, temporally dense self-reports. We conducted a one-hour usability study followed by a within-subject, 6-day to 21-day free-living feasibility study in which participants self-reported their physical activities and postures once every 2 to 5 minutes. We qualitatively explored the usability of the system and identified factors impacting the response rates of this data collection method. Despite being interrupted 12 to 20 times per hour, participants in the free-living study were highly engaged with the system, with an average response rate of 67.7% for audio-μEMA for up to 14 days. We discuss the factors that impacted feasibility; some implementation, methodological, and participant challenges we observed; and important considerations relevant to deploying audio-μEMA in real-time activity recognition systems."

In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with university students to understand the unique challenges in the mental health medication management process and their coping strategies, particularly examining the role of various technologies in this process. We discovered that due to struggles with self-acceptance and the interdependent relationship between medication, symptoms, schedules, and life changes, the medication management process for students was a highly dynamic journey involving frequent dosage changes. Thus, students adopted flexible strategies of using minimal technology to manage their medication in different situations while maintaining a high degree of autonomy.

This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities.

To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. Toward this, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is slow, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities.

To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions. We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study."

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3448116","Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that ""negated"" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such ""negative"" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers."

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3432220","Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-the-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress. There is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions."

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two datasets, Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (TACoS), and wet lab, using conventional evaluation measures such as the Jaccard Index and Hamming Loss, as well as a human-subjects study."

In this article, we first showcase a user study on how anchoring bias can potentially affect mental model formations when users initially interact with an intelligent system and the role of explanations in addressing this bias. Using a video activity recognition tool in cooking domain, we asked participants to verify whether a set of kitchen policies are being followed, with each policy focusing on a weakness or a strength. We controlled the order of the policies and the presence of explanations to test our hypotheses. Our main finding shows that those who observed system strengths early on were more prone to automation bias and made significantly more errors due to positive first impressions of the system, while they built a more accurate mental model of the system competencies. However, those who encountered weaknesses earlier made significantly fewer errors, since they tended to rely more on themselves, while they also underestimated model competencies due to having a more negative first impression of the model.

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return."

Many sources of this data—like code, forum posts, personal websites, and books—are easily attributed to one or a few “users”. In this paper, we ask if it is possible to infer if any of a _user’s_ data was used to train an LLM. Not only would this constitute a breach of privacy, but it would also enable users to detect when their data was used for training. We develop the first effective attacks for _user inference_—at times, with near-perfect success—against LLMs. Our attacks are easy to employ, requiring only black-box access to an LLM and a few samples from the user, which _need not be the ones that were trained on_. We find, both theoretically and empirically, that certain properties make users more susceptible to user inference: being an outlier, having highly correlated examples, and contributing a larger fraction of data. Based on these findings, we identify several methods for mitigating user inference including training with example-level differential privacy, removing within-user duplicate examples, and reducing a user’s contribution to the training data. Though these provide partial mitigation, our work highlights the need to develop methods to fully protect LLMs from user inference."

Most MI research focuses on the case of a single standalone model, while production machine-learning platforms often update models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the attacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage of one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to leverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against the original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific ways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions and tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative justification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show that our attacks are effective at using update information to give the adversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also compared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a related machine-unlearning setting. We perform the first measurements of the impact of distribution shift on MI attacks with model updates, and show that a more drastic distribution shift results in significantly higher MI risk than a gradual shift. We also show that our attacks are effective at auditing differentially private fine tuning. We make our code public on Github: https://github.com/stanleykywu/model-updates.

Poisoning attacks against machine learning induce adversarial modification of data used by a machine learning algorithm to selectively change its output when it is deployed. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning attack called a subpopulation attack, which is particularly relevant when datasets are large and diverse. We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat."

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation."

Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty.

However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the output circle-valued maps can be ""geometrically correlated"" even if the chosen cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case, corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet energy. We describe a systematic procedure for constructing low energy torus-valued maps on data, starting from a set of linearly independent cohomology classes.

This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view, and, as an application, we describe an algorithm which takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation of it in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations, obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction, along the initial global representation. We demonstrate this algorithm on examples coming from dynamical systems and chemistry.

The size and severity of wildfires in the region have been increasing in recent years, making it a pressing concern for communities, ecosystems, and the economy. The accurate and timely detection of active wildfires in remote areas is crucial for effective wildfire management and mitigation efforts. In this research paper, we propose a robust approach for detecting active wildfires using multispectral satellite imagery by leveraging vision transformers and a vast repository of landsat- 8 8 satellite data with a 30 30 m spatial resolution in North America. Our methodology involves experimenting with vision transformers and deep convolutional neural networks for wildfire detection in multispectral satellite images. We compare the capabilities of these two architecture families in detecting wildfires within the multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, we propose a novel u-shape vision transformer that effectively captures spatial dependencies and learns meaningful representations from multispectral images, enabling precise discrimination between wildfire and non-wildfire regions. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conducted experiments on a comprehensive dataset of wildfire incidents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately detecting active wildfires with an \textit{Dice Score or F 1 1 } of and \textit{Recall} of . Overall, our research presents a promising approach for leveraging vision transformers for multispectral satellite imagery to detect remote wildfires."

Meanwhile, some critical theorists have proposed sousveillance as a potential means of countering such abuses of power, whereby those under surveillance monitor those in positions of authority (e.g., gig workers collect data about requesters/platforms). To understand the benefits of sousveillance systems in the gig economy, we conducted semi-structured interviews and led co-design activities with gig workers.

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3476060","Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was3.76.But,weestimatedthatcrowdworkersinourstudyspent332.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing."

We uncover that workers pushed for marketplaces that either empowered workers to set their own salaries without requiring a minimum wage or had intelligent algorithms that could automatically decide the salaries while also ensuring everyone received a minimum wage. Requesters were consistent in their preference of paying by commission and preferred markets that automatically set the salary.

One reason for this is that it is difficult for workers to accurately gauge the hourly wages of microtasks, and they consequently end up performing labor with little pay. In general, workers are provided with little information about tasks, and are left to rely on noisy signals, such as textual description of the task or rating of the requester. This study explores various computational methods for predicting the working times (and thus hourly wages) required for tasks based on data collected from other workers completing crowd work. We provide the following contributions. (i) A data collection method for gathering real-world training data on crowd-work tasks and the times required for workers to complete them; (ii) TurkScanner: a machine learning approach that predicts the necessary working time to complete a task (and can thus implicitly provide the expected hourly wage). We collected 9,155 data records using a web browser extension installed by 84 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and explored the challenge of accurately recording working times both automatically and by asking workers. TurkScanner was created using ~ 150 derived features, and was able to predict the hourly wages of 69.6% of all the tested microtasks within a 75% error. Directions for future research include observing the effects of tools on people's working practices, adapting this approach to a requester tool for better price setting, and predicting other elements of work (e.g., the acceptance likelihood and worker task preferences.)"

While differential privacy (DP) mitigates such risks, it has several limitations in achieving an optimal balance between utility and privacy, include limited resolution in expressing this tradeoff in only a few privacy parameters, and intractable sensitivity calculations that may be necessary to provide tight privacy guarantees. We propose a game-theoretic framework that models privacy protection from MIA as a Bayesian game between a defender and an attacker. In this game, a dataset is the defender's private information, with privacy loss to the defender (which is gain to the attacker) captured in terms of the attacker's ability to infer membership of individuals in the dataset. To address the strategic complexity of this game, we represent the mixed strategy of the defender as a neural network generator which maps a private dataset to its public representation (for example, noisy summary statistics), while the mixed strategy of the attacker is captured by a discriminator which makes membership inference claims. We refer to the resulting computational approach as a general-sum Generative Adversarial Network, which is trained iteratively by alternating generator and discriminator updates akin to conventional GANs. We call the defender's data sharing policy thereby obtained Bayes-Nash Generative Privacy (BNGP). The BNGP strategy avoids sensitivity calculations, supports compositions of correlated mechanisms, is robust to the attacker's heterogeneous preferences over true and false positives, and yields provable differential privacy guarantees, albeit in an idealized setting."

However, numerous studies have demonstrated that even sharing summary genomic information exposes individual members of such datasets to a significant privacy risk due to membership inference attacks. While several approaches have emerged that reduce privacy risks by adding noise or reducing the amount of information shared, these typically assume non-adaptive attacks that use likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistics. We propose a Bayesian game-theoretic framework for optimal privacy-utility tradeoff in the sharing of genomic summary statistics. Our first contribution is to prove that a very general Bayesian attacker model that anchors our game-theoretic approach is more powerful than the conventional LRT-based threat models in that it induces worse privacy loss for the defender who is modeled as a von Neumann-Morgenstern (vNM) decision-maker. We show this to be true even when the attacker uses a non-informative subjective prior. Next, we present an analytically tractable approach to compare the Bayesian attacks with arbitrary subjective priors and the Neyman-Pearson optimal LRT attacks under the Gaussian mechanism common in differential privacy frameworks. Finally, we propose an approach for approximating Bayes-Nash equilibria of the game using deep neural network generators to implicitly represent player mixed strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed game-theoretic framework yields both stronger attacks and stronger defense strategies than the state of the art."

The computational protocols typically adopted to protect individual privacy include sharing summary statistics, such as allele frequencies, or limiting query responses to the presence/absence of alleles of interest using web-services called Beacons. However, even such limited releases are susceptible to likelihood-ratio-based membership-inference attacks. Several approaches have been proposed to preserve privacy, which either suppress a subset of genomic variants or modify query responses for specific variants (e.g., adding noise, as in differential privacy). However, many of these approaches result in a significant utility loss, either suppressing many variants or adding a substantial amount of noise. In this paper, we introduce optimization-based approaches to explicitly trade off the utility of summary data or Beacon responses and privacy with respect to membership-inference attacks based on likelihood-ratios, combining variant suppression and modification. We consider two attack models. In the first, an attacker applies a likelihood-ratio test to make membership-inference claims. In the second model, an attacker uses a threshold that accounts for the effect of the data release on the separation in scores between individuals in the dataset and those who are not. We further introduce highly scalable approaches for approximately solving the privacy-utility tradeoff problem when information is either in the form of summary statistics or presence/absence queries. Finally, we show that the proposed approaches outperform the state of the art in both utility and privacy through an extensive evaluation with public datasets."

At the same time, genomic data has become valuable for reuse beyond their initial point of collection, but privacy concerns often hinder access. Beacon services have emerged to broaden accessibility to such data. These services enable users to query for the presence of a particular minor allele in a dataset, and information helps care providers determine if genomic variation is spurious or has some known clinical indication. However, various studies have shown that this process can leak information regarding if individuals are members of the underlying dataset. There are various approaches to mitigate this vulnerability, but they are limited in that they (1) typically rely on heuristics to add noise to the Beacon responses; (2) offer probabilistic privacy guarantees only, neglecting data utility; and (3) assume a batch setting where all queries arrive at once. In this article, we present a novel algorithmic framework to ensure privacy in a Beacon service setting with a minimal number of query response flips. We represent this problem as one of combinatorial optimization in both the batch setting and the online setting (where queries arrive sequentially). We introduce principled algorithms with both privacy and, in some cases, worst-case utility guarantees.

To promote discovery, collected genomic data is often de-identified and shared, either in public repositories, such as OpenSNP, or with researchers through access-controlled repositories. However, recent studies have suggested that genomic data can be effectively matched to high-resolution three-dimensional face images, which raises a concern that the increasingly ubiquitous public face images can be linked to shared genomic data, thereby re-identifying individuals in the genomic data. While these investigations illustrate the possibility of such an attack, they assume that those performing the linkage have access to extremely well-curated data. Given that this is unlikely to be the case in practice, it calls into question the pragmatic nature of the attack. As such, we systematically study this re-identification risk from two perspectives: first, we investigate how successful such linkage attacks can be when real face images are used, and second, we consider how we can empower individuals to have better control over the associated re-identification risk. We observe that the true risk of re-identification is likely substantially smaller for most individuals than prior literature suggests. In addition, we demonstrate that the addition of a small amount of carefully crafted noise to images can enable a controlled trade-off between re-identification success and the quality of shared images, with risk typically significantly lowered even with noise that is imperceptible to humans."

Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks.As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to “distill” LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B.

Abstract Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups."

FactPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, Llama-2, and Alpaca), with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level."

In this work we propose a method to use LLMs to identify pieces of evidence in patient EHR data that indicate increased or decreased risk of specific diagnoses; our ultimate aim is to increase access to evidence and reduce diagnostic errors. In particular, we propose a Neural Additive Model to make predictions backed by evidence with individualized risk estimates at time-points where clinicians are still uncertain, aiming to specifically mitigate delays in diagnosis and errors stemming from an incomplete differential. To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual “true” diagnoses. We do so with LLMs, to ensure that the input text is from before a confident diagnosis can be made. We use an LLM to retrieve an initial pool of evidence, but then refine this set of evidence according to correlations learned by the model. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of the usefulness of our approach by simulating how it might be used by a clinician to decide between a pre-defined list of differential diagnoses."

However, LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentially misleading) texts by hallucination or omission. In healthcare, this can make LLMs unusable at best and dangerous at worst. We conducted 16 interviews with international systematic review experts to characterize the perceived utility and risks of LLMs in the specific context of medical evidence reviews. Experts indicated that LLMs can assist in the writing process by drafting summaries, generating templates, distilling information, and crosschecking information. They also raised concerns regarding confidently composed but inaccurate LLM outputs and other potential downstream harms, including decreased accountability and proliferation of low-quality reviews. Informed by this qualitative analysis, we identify criteria for rigorous evaluation of biomedical LLMs aligned with domain expert views."

Therefore, we introduce a dataset of human-assessed summary quality facets and pairwise preferences to encourage and support the development of better automated evaluation methods for literature review MDS. We take advantage of community submissions to the Multi-document Summarization for Literature Review (MSLR) shared task to compile a diverse and representative sample of generated summaries. We analyze how automated summarization evaluation metrics correlate with lexical features of generated summaries, to other automated metrics including several we propose in this work, and to aspects of human-assessed summary quality.

This is of particular interest in the medical domain, where alignments might highlight regions in an image relevant to specific phenomena described in free-text. While past work has suggested that attention “heatmaps” can be interpreted in this manner, there has been little evaluation of such alignments. We compare alignments from a state-of-the-art multimodal (image and text) model for EHR with human annotations that link image regions to sentences. Our main finding is that the text has an often weak or unintuitive influence on attention; alignments do not consistently reflect basic anatomical information. Moreover, synthetic modifications — such as substituting “left” for “right” — do not substantially influence highlights. Simple techniques such as allowing the model to opt out of attending to the image and few-shot finetuning show promise in terms of their ability to improve alignments with very little or no supervision.

In this scenario, facilitating analysis of such reports via automation has the potential to rapidly identify safety signals. Unfortunately, public resources for developing natural language models for this task are scant.

Apparent subgroup performance varies substantially for seeds that yield similar overall performance, although there is no evidence of a trade-off between overall and subgroup performance. However, we also find that the small sample sizes inherent to looking at intersections of minority groups and somewhat rare conditions limit our ability to accurately estimate disparities. Further, we find that jointly optimizing for high overall performance and low disparities does not yield statistically significant improvements.

Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.

Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data. We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.

We introduce Energy Score, a proper scoring rule, to evaluate probabilistic predictions. We propose a novel deep dynamics model, Probabilistic Equivariant Continuous COnvolution (PECCO) for probabilistic prediction of multi-agent trajectories.

This network can be trained end-to-end with an equivariant task network to learn an explicitly symmetric representation. We validate this approach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3 distinct forms of symmetry. Our experiments demonstrate that SENs facilitate the application of equivariant networks to data with complex symmetry representations.

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

Our AI agent system leverages GPT-4, a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate human behavior. Our LLM-based agent, deployed in VRChat as a Non-playable Character (NPC), exhibits the ability to respond to a player by providing context-relevant responses followed by appropriate facial expressions and body gestures. Our preliminary evaluation yielded the most optimal parameters for generating the most plausible responses. With our system, we lay the groundwork for future development of LLM-based NPCs in VR."

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

In particular, solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) over manifolds depend critically on the underlying geometry. While graph neural networks have been successfully applied to PDEs, they do not incorporate surface geometry and do not consider local gauge symmetries of the manifold. Alternatively, recent works on gauge equivariant convolutional and attentional architectures on meshes leverage the underlying geometry but underperform in modeling surface PDEs with complex nonlinear dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce a new gauge equivariant architecture using nonlinear message passing. Our novel architecture achieves higher performance than either convolutional or attentional networks on domains with highly complex and nonlinear dynamics. However, similar to the non-mesh case, design trade-offs favor convolutional, attentional, or message passing networks for different tasks; we investigate in which circumstances our message passing method provides the most benefit."

To achieve this, we propose to (i) decompose the multi-modal dynamics into elemental movement primitives, (ii) parameterize each primitive using a recurrent graph neural network to capture interactions, and (iii) integrate a high-level planner that composes primitives sequentially and a low-level controller to combine primitive dynamics and inverse kinematics control.

It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. Results We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

Since many tissues have complex morphology, treatments and conditions often affect the spatial distribution of the ions in morphology-specific ways. Evaluating the selectivity and the specificity of ion localization and regulation across morphology types is biologically important. However, MSI lacks algorithms for segmenting images at both single-ion and spatial resolution. Results This article contributes spatial-Dirichlet Gaussian mixture model (DGMM), an algorithm and a workflow for the analyses of MSI experiments, that detects components of single-ion images with homogeneous spatial composition. The approach extends DGMMs to account for the spatial structure of MSI. Evaluations on simulated and experimental datasets with diverse MSI workflows demonstrated that spatial-DGMM accurately segments ion images, and can distinguish ions with homogeneous and heterogeneous spatial distribution. We also demonstrated that the extracted spatial information is useful for downstream analyses, such as detecting morphology-specific ions, finding groups of ions with similar spatial patterns, and detecting changes in chemical composition of tissues between conditions.

However, experimental platforms for aptamer screening are costly, and the scarcity of labeled data presents a challenge for supervised methods to learn protein-aptamer binding. To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement. Moreover, we curate five real-world protein-aptamer interaction datasets and show that the contact map predicted by FAFormer serves as a strong binding indicator for aptamer screening."

EnzyGen consists of a novel interleaving network of attention and neighborhood equivariant layers, which captures both long-range correlation in an entire protein sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in 3D space. To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction loss. We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). Experimental results show that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity. These findings demonstrate EnzyGen's superior capability in designing well-folded and effective enzymes binding to specific substrates with high affinities.

To this end, we propose RNAFlow, a flow matching model for protein-conditioned RNA sequence-structure design. Its denoising network integrates an RNA inverse folding model and a pre-trained RosettaFold2NA network for generation of RNA sequences and structures. The integration of inverse folding in the structure denoising process allows us to simplify training by fixing the structure prediction network.

To aid biological discovery with XL-MS/MS, it is essential that pairs of chemically linked peptides be accurately identified, a process that requires: (i) database search, that creates a ranked list of candidate peptide pairs for each experimental spectrum and (ii) false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, that determines the probability of a false match in a group of top-ranked peptide pairs with scores above a given threshold. Currently, the only available FDR estimation mechanism in XL-MS/MS is the target-decoy approach (TDA). However, despite its simplicity, TDA has both theoretical and practical limitations that impact the estimation accuracy and increase run time over potential decoy-free approaches (DFAs). Results We introduce a novel decoy-free framework for FDR estimation in XL-MS/MS. Our approach relies on multi-sample mixtures of skew normal distributions, where the latent components correspond to the scores of correct peptide pairs (both peptides identified correctly), partially incorrect peptide pairs (one peptide identified correctly, the other incorrectly), and incorrect peptide pairs (both peptides identified incorrectly). To learn these components, we exploit the score distributions of first- and second-ranked peptide-spectrum matches for each experimental spectrum and subsequently estimate FDR using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm with constraints. We evaluate the method on ten datasets and provide evidence that the proposed DFA is theoretically sound and a viable alternative to TDA owing to its good performance in terms of accuracy, variance of estimation, and run time.

Well-estimated class priors are key to accurate approximation of posterior distributions and are necessary for the recovery of true classification performance. While significant progress has been made in the past decade, there remains a need for accurate strategies that scale to big data. Motivated by this need, we propose an intuitive and fast nonparametric algorithm to estimate class proportions. Unlike any of the previous methods, our algorithm uses a sampling strategy to repeatedly (1) draw an example from the set of positives, (2) record the minimum distance to any of the unlabeled examples, and (3) remove the nearest unlabeled example. We show that the point of sharp increase in the recorded distances corresponds to the desired proportion of positives in the unlabeled set and train a deep neural network to identify that point. Our distance-based algorithm is evaluated on forty datasets and compared to all currently available methods. We provide evidence that this new approach results in the most accurate performance and can be readily used on large datasets."

Although classification has been extensively studied over the past decades, there remain understudied problems when the training data violate the main statistical assumptions relied upon for accurate learning and model characterization. This particularly holds true in the open world setting where observations of a phenomenon generally guarantee its presence but the absence of such evidence cannot be interpreted as the evidence of its absence. Learning from such data is often referred to as positive-unlabeled learning, a form of semi-supervised learning where all labeled data belong to one (say, positive) class. To improve the best practices in the field, we here study the quality of estimated performance in positive-unlabeled learning in the biomedical domain. We provide evidence that such estimates can be wildly inaccurate, depending on the fraction of positive examples in the unlabeled data and the fraction of negative examples mislabeled as positives in the labeled data. We then present correction methods for four such measures and demonstrate that the knowledge or accurate estimates of class priors in the unlabeled data and noise in the labeled data are sufficient for the recovery of true classification performance. We provide theoretical support as well as empirical evidence for the efficacy of the new performance estimation methods.

Enumerating consistent sub-graphs of directed acyclic graphs: an insight into biomedical ontologies. Bioinformatics (2018) 34(13): i313-i322.","Abstract Motivation: Modern problems of concept annotation associate an object of interest (gene, individual, text document) with a set of interrelated textual descriptors (functions, diseases, topics), often organized in concept hierarchies or ontologies. Most ontology can be seen as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts. Given an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent sub-graph; that is, a sub-graph such that if an object is annotated by a particular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that generalize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large space of possible consistent sub-graphs; however, until now we have not been aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a given ontology. Results: We propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent sub-graphs of DAGs. The algorithm recursively partitions the graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We prove the correctness of this algorithm, propose several practical accelerations, evaluate it on random graphs and then apply it to characterize four major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights into the complexity of concept annotation spaces and its potential influence on the predictability of ontological annotation.

The available methods to assess the impact of these variants rely primarily upon evolutionary conservation with little to no consideration of the structural and functional implications for the protein.

Results: To address this, we investigate protein features underlying loss-of-function genetic variation and develop a machine learning method, MutPred-LOF, for the discrimination of pathogenic and tolerated variants that can also generate hypotheses on specific molecular events disrupted by the variant. We investigate a large set of human variants derived from the Human Gene Mutation Database, ClinVar and the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Our prediction method shows an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.85 for all loss-of-function variants and 0.75 for proteins in which both pathogenic and neutral variants have been observed. We applied MutPred-LOF to a set of 1142 de novo vari3ants from neurodevelopmental disorders and find enrichment of pathogenic variants in affected individuals.

To this end, many studies have investigated the structural and functional impact of amino acid substitutions. Most of these studies were however limited in scope to either individual molecular functions or were concerned with functional effects (e.g. deleterious vs. neutral) without specifically considering possible molecular alterations. The recent growth of structural, molecular and genetic data presents an opportunity for more comprehensive studies to consider the structural environment of a residue of interest, to hypothesize specific molecular effects of sequence variants and to statistically associate these effects with genetic disease. In this study, we analyzed data sets of disease-causing and putatively neutral human variants mapped to protein 3D structures as part of a systematic study of the loss and gain of various types of functional attribute potentially underlying pathogenic molecular alterations. We first propose a formal model to assess probabilistically function-impacting variants. We then develop an array of structure-based functional residue predictors, evaluate their performance, and use them to quantify the impact of disease-causing amino acid substitutions on catalytic activity, metal binding, macromolecular binding, ligand binding, allosteric regulation and post-translational modifications. We show that our methodology generates actionable biological hypotheses for up to 41% of disease-causing genetic variants mapped to protein structures suggesting that it can be reliably used to guide experimental validation. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of disease-causing human variants mapping to protein structures are function-altering both in the presence and absence of stability disruption."

A same query may have multiple valid adjustment sets, each with a different variance. When networks are partially observed, current methods use graph-based criteria to find an adjustment set that minimizes asymptotic variance. Unfortunately, many models that share the same graph topology, and therefore same functional dependencies, may differ in the processes that generate the observational data. In these cases, the topology-based criteria fail to distinguish the variances of the adjustment sets. This deficiency can lead to sub-optimal adjustment sets, and to miss-characterization of the effect of the intervention. We propose an approach for deriving ‘optimal adjustment sets’ that takes into account the nature of the data, bias and finite-sample variance of the estimator, and cost. It empirically learns the data generating processes from historical experimental data, and characterizes the properties of the estimators by simulation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in four biomolecular Case studies with different topologies and different data generation processes.

It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. Results We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

In this paper, we examine the use of Likert scales as a tool for measuring subjective response in a systematic review of 134 visualization evaluations published between 2009 and 2019. We find that papers with both objective and subjective measures do not hold the same reporting and analysis standards for both aspects of their evaluation, producing less rigorous work for the subjective qualities measured by Likert scales. Additionally, we demonstrate that many papers are inconsistent in their interpretations of Likert data as discrete or continuous and may even sacrifice statistical power by applying nonparametric tests unnecessarily. Finally, we identify instances where key details about Likert item construction with the potential to bias participant responses are omitted from evaluation methodology reporting, inhibiting the feasibility and reliability of future replication studies. We summarize recommendations from other fields for best practices with Likert data in visualization evaluations, based on the results of our survey.

Most moving objects become foreground indiscriminately, except in dynamic scenes. We introduce a novel concept of background as the objects other than the foreground. The reference plane is defined a moving object or human walk and the projective depth is defined as the distance between the reference plane and other objects in the scene. We show that this technique is relatively immune to camera motion and performs well for hand-held cameras. It is potentially more powerful than standard methods because of its flexibility of making it possible to select in real-time what to filter out as background. The technique performs better than standard background subtractions without the need for training, camera calibration, disparity map estimation or special camera configurations."

Helping students develop their own analogies is difficult, and limited research exists on scaffolding for student-generated analogies in computing education and STEM education more broadly. This exploratory study examines an open-ended student-generated analogy process, for the concept of variable scope within an introductory computer science course. The primary goal of this study is to lay the foundation for scaffolding strategies to more fully realize the potential of student-generated analogy as an educational tool. In this study, students engaged individually or in small groups to create analogies for describing variable scope. A brief training period and minimal scaffolding were provided, encouraging less restricted exploration of analogy development, while establishing a baseline for students' analogy development skills for future studies. This open-ended approach aligns with the current state of practice in STEM education for student-generated analogies. The analysis, grounded in analogical reasoning, revealed strengths, weaknesses, recurring challenges, providing a foundation for future work in developing targeted scaffolding strategies. Key findings such as difficulties in structural alignment, and strengths like high internal domain consistency, offer valuable insights for future targeted scaffolding strategies to be developed for improved analogy development in computing education."

To address these issues, this study aims to contribute to the development of a reliable, language-independent testing instrument that accurately evaluates students' performance, capabilities, and grasp of the learning outcomes from an introductory computer science course. In this study, we employed the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised version 2 (SCS1Rv2) as a post-assessment tool to measure learning outcomes. The SCS1Rv2 was administered in three CS1 course sections, and the results were compared with the final grades of the students. The validation of the SCS1Rv2 was done using Item Response Theory where the test was assessed for its difficulty and reliability. We found that the SCS1Rv2 is a reasonable predictor of course learning outcomes. The intent of this study is to aid in the creation of a standardized, reliable, and effective testing instrument that can be used across different courses and institutions.

Though there has been much research and innovation in recent years to help reduce high failure rates, a substantial population of students still struggle in a typical CS1 course. In this paper we create an argument of validity of the Placement Skills Inventory (PSIv1). The goal of the PSIv1 is to help advise and place students into an appropriate introductory computing course. While placement exams have been developed in the past, the goal of PSIv1 is to differentiate students who will be successful in a CS1 course and those that would be better served taking a CS0 course as their first computing course. In contrast, traditional placement exams have focused on differentiating students between CS1 and CS2. The PSIv1 is a combination of two instruments, the Computational Thinking Concepts and Skills Test and the Second Computer Science 1 Exam Revised Version 2. These two instruments measure students' computation thinking skills and prior programming knowledge respectively. The PSIv1 was administered to all students enrolled in either a CS0 or CS1 during the first two weeks of the semester. We use Item Response Theory to create an argument of validity of the PSIv1 and look at differences in scores on the PSIv1 based on if a student passed or failed a CS0 and CS1 course. We then used the results to create an advising strategy and criteria to help students decided if they should enroll in a CS0 or CS1 course."

In this paper, we present the results of a comparative analysis of curricula before and after a major structural revision. The first curriculum adheres to the conventional, rigid prerequisite structure, while the second emphasizes student choice and multiple pathways through the degree. No changes were made to course content/outcomes between the two versions. Employing curricular metrics such as complexity and centrality, we examine the degree progress of 3010 students over a six-year period. Specifically, our investigation looks at the impact of reducing curricular complexity on student attrition from and attraction to the CS major. The new curriculum, with a 60% reduction in curricular structural complexity, showed both increased retention of students over the old curriculum (67% to 98%) and an increase in the number of students converting from undeclared to computer science (44% to 69%). Our findings demonstrate that reducing curricular complexity need not compromise program rigor and can benefit students by providing greater flexibility and ensuring earlier exposure to (and therefore retention in) CS."

Focusing on the dimensions of applicant program level (undergraduate versus Master's students), gender, and international versus domestic student designation, we perform an analysis of application patterns. Our results show that program level, gender, and international status all play roles in student application behavior. Further, we identify specific courses that are preferred by various subsets of students, such as a strong affinity of students who have gone through a Master's bridge program to apply to those courses and a tendency for women and non-binary students to apply at greater rates to our first-year seminar, data science, and databases courses. Finally, we investigate the relationship between instructor gender and applicant gender--revealing that when women and non-binary applicants prefer certain courses, these courses tend to also have a greater-than-average representation of women and non-binary instructors. As a result of this analysis, we present three recommended next steps to gain deeper understanding of the observed patterns.

However, our curricula and departments have stayed much the same. We still mostly prepare students for software develop- ment jobs in the technology industry, while we rarely identify the damage that same industry has caused in our democratic societies. How do we do better? How do we change to meet the needs of a changing society? What strategies should we apply? We know that large-scale change will require structural shifts, but such shifts are likely to be slow and expensive, whereas smaller, ""boots on the ground"" initiatives can positively impact individuals but do little to change the systems that underlie the deeper-seated problems in computing. Navigating this paradox is imperative to our success as a field.

DOI: 10.1145/3485488","Gradually typed languages allow programmers to mix statically and dynamically typed code, enabling them to incrementally reap the benefits of static typing as they add type annotations to their code. However, this type migration process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper examines the problem of automated type migration: given a dynamic program, infer additional or improved type annotations. Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities. We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the migration to be compatible with unmigrated code. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ""challenge problems."" Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties of gradual type migration. In addition, we apply TypeWhich to a suite of benchmarks for Grift, a programming language based on the GTLC. TypeWhich is able to reconstruct all human-written annotations on all but one program."

Sampling is an ""embarrassingly parallel"" problem and may appear to lend itself to GPU acceleration, but the irregularity of graphs makes it hard to use GPU resources effectively. This paper presents NextDoor, a system designed to effectively perform graph sampling on GPUs. NextDoor employs a new approach to graph sampling that we call transit-parallelism, which allows load balancing and caching of edges.

The performance of high-level languages depends not only on the underlying performance of WebAssembly, but also on the quality of the generated WebAssembly code. In this paper, we identify several features of high-level languages that current approaches can only compile to WebAssembly by generating complex and inefficient code. We argue that these problems could be addressed if WebAssembly natively supported first-class continuations. We then present Wasm/k, which extends WebAssembly with delimited continuations. Wasm/k introduces no new value types, and thus does not require significant changes to the WebAssembly type system (validation). Wasm/k is safe, even in the presence of foreign function calls (e.g., to and from JavaScript). Finally, Wasm/k is amenable to efficient implementation: we implement Wasm/k as a local change to Wasmtime, an existing WebAssembly JIT. We evaluate Wasm/k by implementing C/k, which adds delimited continuations to C/C++. C/k uses Emscripten and its implementation serves as a case study on how to use Wasm/k in a compiler that targets WebAssembly. We present several case studies using C/k, and show that on implementing green threads, it can outperform the state-of-the-art approach Asyncify with an 18% improvement in performance and a 30% improvement in code size."

We present two key insights about ASPs for robotics. First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we introduce layered dimension-informed program synthesis (LDIPS) - by reasoning about the physical dimensions of state variables, and dimensional constraints on operators, LDIPS directly synthesizes ASPs in a human-interpretable domain-specific language that is amenable to program repair. We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots."

Distinguished Paper Award","Serverless computing (also known as functions as a service) is a new cloud computing abstraction that makes it easier to write robust, large-scale web services. In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λ Λ , an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λ Λ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λ Λ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λ Λ coincide. Second, we augment λ Λ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λ Λ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work. The latest version of this paper, corrects an error in Definition 4.2 and thus the proof of Theorem 4.3, which were found in the published version. PDF available on arXiv"

An automated analysis of the transition function 1) identifies adjustable parameters, 2) converts the transition function into a system of logical constraints, and 3) formulates the constraints and user-supplied corrections as a MaxSMT problem that yields new parameter values.

Several widely-publicized outages have been blamed not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is that configurations can be non-deterministic. This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations. Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver. Rehearsal then leverages the determinacy analysis to check other important properties, such as idempotency. Finally, we apply Rehearsal to several real-world Puppet configurations.

This project aims to foster active learning by allowing students to solve examples through directly selecting, swapping and manipulating nodes and edges of graphs. This game presents a platform for college students to learn and actively practice the Heap data structure, Heapsort algorithm, and minimum weight spanning tree Algorithms such as Kruskal and Prim. Built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Three.js, the game incorporates a 3D interactive environment to pilot these concepts. The platform includes two modes: a training mode, allowing penalty-free practice, and a regular mode with a scoring system, a leaderboard and limited lives to foster engagement, challenge and competitiveness with peers. Multiple levels of difficulty, immediate feedback, and a carefully tailored hint system were designed to support stepwise learning and enhance interactive experience. Anonymous Data collection of number of mistakes, time spent and change of score per level, runs in the background without storing identifying information on the students.

Attendees explore hands-on experiments that are designed for students unlikely to encounter hardware topics in their course of study. These experiments are offered in bridge courses of a graduate program enrolling students without a Computer Science background at Northeastern University (the Align MSCS Program). The workshop consists of 3 groupings of hardware experiments. In one grouping, attendees use breadboarding to construct digital circuits. Transistors and resistors are used to design logic gates; then logic gates are used to design an arithmetic circuit (Half Adder); finally, two Half Adders with an OR gate are cascaded to build a larger adder. In the second grouping, attendees explore the interface between hardware and software, making software concepts tangible. Changing a bit from 0 to 1 in software causes a voltage change on a pin, causing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to light. Operations executed on a Pico microcontroller illustrate programming concepts like ASCII representation and data structures. Additional Python constructs enable the implementation of counters and games. In the third grouping, attendees write C code to realize Linked list, Tree, and Graph implementations on Raspberry Pi (RSPi). These C programs enable hardware components by activating the hardware I/O ports of RSPi."

As the world moves on to data-driven technologies and businesses, the need to educate students in writing accurate and efficient SQL queries has become paramount. Traditional SQL evaluation modes often rely on limited, subjective, and labor-intensive manual grading, which impedes the integration of practical assignments into the curriculum. This poster introduces SQLearn, an innovative automated assessment tool for SQL education. We aim to build a comprehensive platform that addresses submission, evaluation, and review needs amongst students and educators. Here we highlight our assessment approach which breaks down student-submitted queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and uses cosine similarity to evaluate them. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective, not only in binary grading of queries but also in assigning partial grades. The tool also offers an interactive platform to submit and receive feedback, enabling students to refine their SQL skills and gain insights into query structure and optimization. By automating the assessment process, educators can focus on refining the curriculum and channel more time into instruction and research."

This manuscript presents our initial efforts in developing a method that utilizes deep learning to segment specific anatomical structures, namely osseous and myeloid tissues, from MRI scans, with minimal annotated data. We place particular emphasis on a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach, utilizing the U-Net architecture. Our work elaborates on the segmentation process, demonstrates results on individual MRI slices, and proposes a method for volumetric analysis. We also explore potential enhancements for achieving more precise segmentations and robust feature extraction.

In this paper, we present the results of a comparative analysis of curricula before and after a major structural revision. The first curriculum adheres to the conventional, rigid prerequisite structure, while the second emphasizes student choice and multiple pathways through the degree. No changes were made to course content/outcomes between the two versions. Employing curricular metrics such as complexity and centrality, we examine the degree progress of 3010 students over a six-year period. Specifically, our investigation looks at the impact of reducing curricular complexity on student attrition from and attraction to the CS major. The new curriculum, with a 60% reduction in curricular structural complexity, showed both increased retention of students over the old curriculum (67% to 98%) and an increase in the number of students converting from undeclared to computer science (44% to 69%). Our findings demonstrate that reducing curricular complexity need not compromise program rigor and can benefit students by providing greater flexibility and ensuring earlier exposure to (and therefore retention in) CS."

Techniques such as spaced retrieval practice, interleaving, and metacognition are proven by cognitive and educational researchers as strategies that greatly improve learning. They focus on helping students to own responsibility for their learning and retention of information. Considering their benefits, quizzes were re-branded to be formative low-stakes retrieval practice activities (RPAs) in an Introduction to Programming Course (CS1), meaning that students would use the quizzes as learning tools, testing themselves in a spaced and interleaved manner as many times as they want during the semester. Additionally, the U-Behavior learning and teaching method was used. This method applies visualizations of student's study habits and self-reflections to help students to be aware of their study practices, reflect on them, and change their study routine to improve performance and long-term learning. Study behaviors were analyzed and the final Canvas exam, final coding exam, and final course grades were compared for students who spaced and interleaved their practice with students who did not. Results showed a statistically significant increase in all grades evaluated for students who practiced using this novel combination of spacing and interleaving integrated with U-Behavior visualizations and RPA reflection activities for learning."

Our belief for their success is that they must master a growth mindset and that the final grade should represent their final mastery of topics in the course. Traditional grading systems tend to be too restrictive and hinder a growth mindset. They require strict deadlines that fail to easily account for student accommodations and learning differences. Furthermore, they run into averaging and scaling issues with 59% of a score counting as failing, making it difficult for students to redeem grades even if they later demonstrate mastery of topics. We designed a formative/summative grading system in our CS0 and CS1 classes for both on-campus and online students to support a structured growth mindset. Students can redo formative assignments and are provided flexible deadlines. They demonstrate their mastery in summative assignments. While being inspired by other grading systems, our system works seamlessly with auto-grading tools used in large, structured courses. Despite the flexibility, the courses provided a level of rigor before allowing students to continue onto the next course. Overall, 65% of students resubmitted assignments increasing their scores, participated in ungraded assignments, and used formative assignments for additional practice without a distinction between race or gender. These students went to the traditional follow-on CS2 course and 94% passed compared with 71% who took CS1 with a traditional grading system."

However, in spite of the availability of multiple intervention approaches, a key hindrance is reliance on the belief that students know how to study. We dedicated time and resources to not only teach the discipline of Computer Science, but also to teach students how to study using techniques grounded in psychology. We offered a one-credit ""booster"" course to students taking CS 2: Data Structures. Through direct advisor intervention based on the first exam grade, students were encouraged to take the booster course along with traditional interventions. We then tracked student growth across exams for the course as students were learning and being held accountable to study techniques not often emphasized in Computer Science. The students continued to increase their grades throughout the semester relative to the students who chose to not take the booster class. The students who were targeted for intervention but did not take the booster course continued to have lower grades throughout the semester, and only 41% of them passed the course. Students who participated in the booster course showed a 31% rate of growth across the semester, taking a failing grade to a passing grade, with 100% passing the course with a C or above. These results show a significant influence to help students succeed, which led to higher retention and increased grades. If we want students to truly succeed, we must teach them to study."

Over the past 60 years about a third of the students either fail or drop out of the course. Past research has focused on improving teaching methods through small changes without changing the overall course structure. The premise of our research is that restructuring the CS 1 course using a Spiral pedagogy based on principles for improving memory and recall can help students learn the information and retain it for future courses. Using the principles of Spacing, Interleaving, Elaboration, Practiced Retrieval, and Reflection, we fundamentally redesigned CS 1 with a complete reordering of topics. We evaluated the newly designed CS 1 by comparing the students with those coming from a traditional offering in terms of (1) CS 1 performance, (2) retention of students between CS 1 and 2, and (3) CS 2 performance. We demonstrate that the Spiral method helped students outperform those who learn via the traditional method by 9% on final exam scores in CS 1. Retention is increased between CS 1 and CS 2 with a 19.2% increase for women, and 9.2% overall. Furthermore, students continue to do better in CS 2 with increased grades across all assessments and show a 15% increase in passing grades. We provide a framework for the Spiral methodology so that others may replicate the design. Our results lead us to consider evaluating and improving the underlying methodology with which we teach Computer Science."

The first CS course in the State to be accepted as a GT-Pathway course. This redesign had to be carefully done due to a need to introduce liberal arts style topics such as CS History, Philosophy and Ethics and Inclusive Design issues, while maintaining current coding and student success standards that were already expected for the CS-0 at the university. We termed this combination as Culture and Coding. In order to add more without reducing retention, the course was redesigned around the Psychology of Learning and spacing of topics in a ""Spiral"" Manner. Each topic was briefly introduced, and throughout the semester, students would dive deeper into the topics. This allowed for a 50% reduction of time focused on teaching coding topics, with students performing equivalent on exams compared to previous models of the course that focused 100% of the time on coding topics. Furthermore, students taught by the spiral teaching method outperformed students taught using traditional methods in the follow-on course. Our evaluation suggests that the spiral model of teaching computer science may allow for greater retention of topics, allowing classes to either cover additional concepts or go more in depth on current topics."

Both sections of CS1 were taught with the same curriculum and assessments. We find that the advantages of prior experience are substantial, with P students outscoring N students by more than 6% on exams and 10% on programming quizzes. However, the performance gap between P and N students narrows considerably by the end of the following CS2 course, with no significant difference in overall scores. Analyzing results by gender, our data shows that 22% of N students in CS1 are female versus only 12% of P students. However, the female students with prior exposure outperform their male peers in all areas.

Our data was gathered over the span of four years and represents 15,000+ individual applications for all courses in Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Focusing on the dimensions of applicant program level (undergraduate versus Master's students), gender, and international versus domestic student designation, we perform an analysis of application patterns. Our results show that program level, gender, and international status all play roles in student application behavior. Further, we identify specific courses that are preferred by various subsets of students, such as a strong affinity of students who have gone through a Master's bridge program to apply to those courses and a tendency for women and non-binary students to apply at greater rates to our first-year seminar, data science, and databases courses. Finally, we investigate the relationship between instructor gender and applicant gender--revealing that when women and non-binary applicants prefer certain courses, these courses tend to also have a greater-than-average representation of women and non-binary instructors. As a result of this analysis, we present three recommended next steps to gain deeper understanding of the observed patterns. This work demonstrates that with a centralized TA application system, an institution can gain a comprehensive understanding of application behaviors--leading to informed decisions about where to potentially intervene, especially with an eye toward broadening participation in computing at all levels."

Our policy reduced the stress that students felt each week, stabilized the amount of time they spent on assignments, and ask them to reflect on their code to request feedback from the teaching team. Students could receive full credit for a homework assignment even if it was incomplete, making office hours less hectic. Students could also submit their homework after working on it for a certain number of hours, even if a bug still existed. Our ungrading policy also helped our TAs feel valued.

Second, that it is vital the curriculum is designed based on peer-to-peer learning and actively incorporates abstract pedagogical reflection into the materials. When TAs are taught the content, it is grounded in the same techniques that we are encouraging them to use and that, as computing faculty, we ourselves use.

How well a caption fits an image can be difficult to assess due to the subjective nature of caption quality. How do we evaluate whether a caption is good? We generated a new dataset to help answer this question by using our new image caption rating system, which consists of a novel robust rating scale and gamified approach to gathering human ratings. We show that our approach is consistent and teachable. 113 participants were involved in generating the dataset, which is composed of 68,217 ratings among 15,646 image-caption pairs. Our new dataset has greater inter-rater agreement than the state of the art, and custom machine learning rating predictors that were trained on our dataset outperform previous metrics.

While HMMs were originally developed and widely used in speech recognition, they have shown great performance in human motion and activity modeling. We make an analogy between human language and teleoperated robotic processes (i.e., words are analogous to a teleoperator’s gestures, sentences are analogous to the entire teleoperated task or process) and implement HMMs to model the teleoperated task. To test the continuous authentication performance of the proposed method, we conducted two sets of analyses. We built a virtual reality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive) and haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a real teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then conducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by using the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The performance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time) operator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated impersonation attack. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to achieve 70% (VR experiment) and 81% (JIGSAWS dataset) continuous classification accuracy with as short as a 1-second sample window. It is also capable of detecting an impersonation attack in real-time."

While nearly all modern networking devices and operating systems support IPv6, it remains unclear how this basic support translates into higher-layer functionality, privacy, and security in consumer IoT devices. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of IPv6 usage in smart homes in a testbed equipped with 93 distinct, popular consumer IoT devices. We investigate whether and how they support and use IPv6, focusing on factors such as IPv6 addressing, configuration, DNS and destinations, and privacy and security practices. We find that, despite most devices having some degree of IPv6 support, in an IPv6-only network just 20.4% transmit data to Internet IPv6 destinations, and only 8.6% remain functional, indicating that consumer IoT devices are not yet ready for IPv6 networks. Furthermore, 16.1% of devices use easily traceable IPv6 addresses, posing privacy risks. Our findings highlight the inadequate IPv6 support in consumer IoT devices compared to conventional devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This gap is concerning, as it may lead to not only usability issues but also privacy and security risks for smart home users."

Our results show that Amazon and third parties, including advertising and tracking services that are unique to the smart speaker ecosystem, collect smart speaker interaction data. We also find that Amazon processes smart speaker interaction data to infer user interests and uses those inferences to serve targeted ads to users.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive and empirical measurement study to shed light on the local communication within a smart home deployment and its threats. We use a unique combination of passive network traffic captures, protocol honeypots, dynamic mobile app analysis, and crowdsourced IoT data from participants to identify and analyze a wide range of device activities on the local network. We then analyze these datasets to characterize local network protocols, security and privacy threats associated with them. Our analysis reveals vulnerable devices, insecure use of network protocols, and sensitive data exposure by IoT devices. We provide evidence of how this information is exfiltrated to remote servers by mobile apps and third-party SDKs, potentially for household fingerprinting, surveillance and cross-device tracking.

In this work, we study a large number of TLS-enabled consumer IoT devices to shed light on how effectively they use TLS, in terms of establishing secure connections and correctly validating certificates, and how observed behavior changes over time. To this end, we gather more than two years of TLS network traffic from IoT devices, conduct active probing to test for vulnerabilities, and develop a novel blackbox technique for exploring the trusted root stores in IoT devices by exploiting a side-channel through TLS Alert Messages. We find a wide range of behaviors across devices, with some adopting best security practices but most being vulnerable in one or more of the following ways: use of old/insecure protocol versions and/or ciphersuites, lack of certificate validation, and poor maintenance of root stores. Specifically, we find that at least 8 IoT devices still include distrusted certificates in their root stores, 11/32 devices are vulnerable to TLS interception attacks, and that many devices fail to adopt modern protocol features over time. Our findings motivate the need for IoT manufacturers to audit, upgrade, and maintain their devices' TLS implementations in a consistent and uniform way that safeguards all of their network traffic."

We perform manual tests, identify dark patterns in each service, and examine how they persist or differ by modality. Our findings show that while services can employ some dark patterns equally across modalities, many dark patterns vary between platforms, and that these differences saddle people with inconsistent experiences of autonomy, privacy, and control.

We establish epistemic autonomy by applying the transfeminine principle of autonomy to the problem of epistemic injustice. To articulate the harm of violating one's epistemic autonomy, we present six stories from two trans women: (1) a transfem online administrator and (2) a transfem researcher. We then synthesize our definition of epistemic autonomy in research into a research paradigm. Finally, we present two variants of common HCI methods, autoethnography and asynchronous remote communities, that stem from these beliefs.

However, current platforms are not designed in a way that accounts for sapphic lived experience, especially the lived experience of sapphics who hold multiple marginalized identity characteristics. Even on platforms that do exist for sapphics, transgender women and nonbinary people are often subject to discrimination, fetishization, and stigmatization. To aid in the design of platforms that better serve the needs of multiply marginalized sapphics, we engaged a diverse group of 25 sapphics in six rounds of community discussion on key topics for relationship platform design. Based on participant discussions, we identify key challenges when designing for multiply marginalized sapphics around relationship structures, gender and sexuality classification, and safety priorities for interaction. We present two design priorities alongside community-sourced design directions which can help future designers address these challenges: identity-centric safety and community-based information formats."

Whose Knowledge is Valued? Epistemic Injustice in CSCW Applications Proc. ACM Hum. Comput. Interact., 8, 1-28. https://doi.org/10.1145/3687062","Social computing scholars have long known that people do not interact with knowledge in straightforward ways, especially in digital environments. While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional, often non-Western, ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards epistemic justice. In sum, we recount, synthesize, and propose solutions for the various forms of epistemic injustice that CSCW sites of study---including CSCW itself---propagate."

However, these discussions have largely centered around member-researcher status and positionality when working with queer populations. Based on insights gathered at multiple ACM events over the past two years, we identified two pressing issues: (1) we need to better support queer people doing HCI research not specific to queer populations, and (2) we need to identify how to best support member-researchers in leading Queer HCI while including collaborators beyond the queer community.

However, the efficacy of this strategy in limiting the delivery of harmful content to users is not well understood. In this paper, we create a framework to quantify the efficacy of content moderation and use our metrics to analyze content removal on Facebook within the U.S. news ecosystem. In a data set of over 2M posts with 1.6B user engagements collected from 2,551 U.S. news sources before and during the Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021, we identify 10,811 removed posts. We find that the active engagement life cycle of Facebook posts is very short, with 90% of all engagement occurring within the first 30 hours after posting. Thus, even relatively quick intervention allowed significant accrual of engagement before removal, and prevented only 21% of the predicted engagement potential during a baseline period before the U.S. Capitol attack. Nearly a week after the attack, Facebook began removing older content, but these removals occurred so late in these posts' engagement life cycles that they disrupted less than 1% of predicted future engagement, highlighting the limited impact of this intervention. Content moderation likely has limits in its ability to prevent engagement, especially in a crisis, and we recommend that other approaches such as slowing down the rate of content diffusion be investigated."

In this paper, we quantify whether Facebook’s current enforcement correctly identifies political ads and ensures compliance by advertisers. In a comprehensive, large-scale analysis of 4.2 million political and 29.6 million non-political ads from 215,030 advertisers, we identify ads correctly detected as political (true positives), ads incorrectly detected (false positives), and ads missed by detection (false negatives). Facebook’s current enforcement appears imprecise: 61% more ads are missed than are detected worldwide, and 55% of U.S. detected ads are in fact non-political. Detection performance is uneven across countries, with some having up to 53 times higher false negative rates among clearly political pages than in the U.S. Moreover, enforcement appears inadequate for preventing systematic violations of political advertising policies: for example, advertisers were able to continue running political ads without disclosing them while they were temporarily prohibited in the U.S. We attribute these flaws to five gaps in Facebook’s current enforcement and transparency implementation, and close with recommendations to improve the security of the online political ad ecosystem.

However, existing architectural designs that support heterogeneous teams tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Some attempt to encode diverse behaviors within a single shared architecture by appending the input with an ID unique to each robot or robot type. These designs improve sample and parameter efficiency but tend to limit behavioral diversity. Others use a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. We view these two designs as ends of a spectrum and explore a middle-ground approach that enables efficient learning of diverse behaviors. Inspired by work in transfer learning and meta RL, and building upon prior work in trait-based task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a general-purpose soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to enable a single architecture to dynamically adapt to each robot and the current context. Intuitively, CASH encodes shared decision making strategies that can be adapted to each robot based on local observations and the robots' individual and collective capabilities (e.g., speed and payload). CASH explicitly captures the impact of capabilities on collective behavior, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. We conducted experiments across four heterogeneous coordination tasks and three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL) using SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, CASH generates appropriately diverse behaviors and outperforms baseline architectures in task performance and sample efficiency during training and zero-shot generalization while utilizing 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters."

By emitting deliberately designed acoustic signals, an adversary can control the output of an inertial sensor, which triggers unnecessary motion compensation and results in a blurred image. These blurred images can induce object misclassification, affecting safety-critical decision-making.

We prove that our result guarantees robust hyperproperty preservation, an important criterion for compiler correctness that preserves all source-level security properties in target programs.

At the same time, most developers lack the training to securely employ cryptography. We present Viaduct, a compiler that transforms high-level programs into secure, efficient distributed realizations. Viaduct's source language allows developers to declaratively specify security policies by annotating their programs with information flow labels. The compiler uses these labels to synthesize distributed programs that use cryptography efficiently while still defending the source-level security policy. The Viaduct approach is general, and can be easily extended with new security mechanisms. Our implementation of the Viaduct compiler comes with an extensible runtime system that includes plug-in support for multiparty computation, commitments, and zero-knowledge proofs.

Our protocol achieves malicious security in the honest-majority setting and relies on the hardness of the Learning Party with Noise assumption."

In this work, we step back from the highly-specific exploits hogging the spotlight, and present the first work that systematically explores HRS within a scientific framework.

Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values."

One well-known instance of these attacks is the widespread use of trick banners that use social engineering techniques to lure victims into clicking on deceptive fake links, potentially leading to a malicious domain or malware. A recent and pervasive trend by attackers is to imitate the ""download"" or ""play"" buttons in popular file sharing sites (e.g., one-click hosters, video-streaming sites, bittorrent sites) in an attempt to trick users into clicking on these fake banners instead of the genuine link. In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically assisting Internet users in detecting malicious trick banners and helping them identify the correct link. We present a set of features to characterize trick banners based on their visual properties such as image size, color, placement on the enclosing webpage, whether they contain animation effects, and whether they consistently appear with the same visual properties on consecutive loads of the same webpage. We have implemented a tool called TrueClick, which uses image processing and machine learning techniques to build a classifier based on these features to automatically detect the trick banners on a webpage. Our approach automatically classifies trick banners, and requires no manual effort to compile blacklists as current approaches do. Our experiments show that TrueClick results in a 3.55 factor improvement in correct link selection in the absence of other ad blocking software, and that it can detect trick banners missed by a popular ad detection tool, Adblock Plus."

Prior studies have examined moderation tools and practices, moderation challenges, and the emotional labor and burnout of volunteer moderators. However, researchers have yet to delve into the ways moderators support one another in combating hate and harassment within the communities they moderate through participation in meta-communities of moderators. To address this gap, we have conducted a qualitative content analysis of 115 hate and harassment-related threads from r/ModSupport and r/modhelp, two major subreddit forums for moderators for this type of mutual support. Our study reveals that moderators seek assistance on topics ranging from fighting attacks to understanding Reddit policies and rules to just venting their frustration. Other moderators respond to these requests by validating their frustration and challenges, showing emotional support, and providing information and tangible resources to help with their situation. Based on these findings, we share the implications of our work in facilitating platform and peer support for online volunteer moderators on Reddit and similar platforms.

We scraped Twitter to gather 5252 Carrds from fans in a variety of fandoms, which we analyzed using a combination of keyword searches and hand-coding. Fans’ Carrds frequently disclose queer identity, and articulate a complex system of community values and boundary management. Inspired by how these findings aren’t well-explained by individual theories of privacy, we articulate first steps towards a theory of collective privacy based in a communal process of values construction, trust building, and personal disclosure that we believe helps us to understand the sophisticated nature of fans’ observed behaviors."

We use privacy scholarship and existing theories thereof to examine these norms and bring an additional perspective to understanding fandom communities. In this work, we analyze over 250,000 words of ""meta'' essays and comments on those essays, reflecting the views and debates of hundreds of fans on these privacy norms. Drawing on Solove's theory of privacy as an aggregation of different ideas and on a variety of other academic theories of privacy, we analyze these norms as highly effective at protecting the integrity of fannish activities.

However, existing research, primarily model-centered, does not provide insight into users' perspectives. To bridge this gap, we analyzed sensitive disclosures in real-world ChatGPT conversations and conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 LLM-based CA users. We found that users are constantly faced with trade-offs between privacy, utility, and convenience when using LLM-based CAs. However, users' erroneous mental models and the dark patterns in system design limited their awareness and comprehension of the privacy risks. Additionally, the human-like interactions encouraged more sensitive disclosures, which complicated users' ability to navigate the trade-offs. We discuss practical design guidelines and the needs for paradigm shifts to protect the privacy of LLM-based CA users."

We also quantify how accurately user assessments match published data collection practices, and we identify a commonly-held misconception about how payments are processed.

However, the landscape of online crowdsourcing has changed significantly over the last five years, with the rise of Prolific as a major platform and the increasing presence of bots. This work attempts to replicate the prior results about the external validity of online privacy and security surveys. We conduct an online survey on MTurk (n=800), a gender-balanced survey on Prolific (n=800), and a representative survey on Prolific (n=800) and compare the responses to a probabilistic survey conducted by the Pew Research Center (n=4272). We find that MTurk response quality has degraded over the last five years, and our results do not replicate the earlier finding about the generalizability of MTurk responses. By contrast, we find that data collected through Prolific is generally representative for questions about user perceptions and experiences, but not for questions about security and privacy knowledge. We also evaluate the impact of Prolific settings, attention check questions, and statistical methods on the external validity of online surveys, and we develop recommendations about best practices for conducting online privacy and security surveys."

This work investigates the role technical terms play in policy transparency. We identify potentially misunderstood technical terms that appear in privacy policies through a survey of current privacy policies and a pilot user study. We then run a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate whether users can accurately define these technical terms, to identify commonly held misconceptions, and to investigate how the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with privacy policies. We find that technical terms are broadly misunderstood and that particular misconceptions are common. We also find that the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with various privacy policies and their reported likeliness to accept those policies. We conclude that current use of technical terms in privacy policies poses a challenge to policy transparency and user privacy, and that companies should take steps to mitigate this effect.

Over the years, informal conventions or ""norms"" for transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based on their offered ""transaction fee-per-byte."" Bitcoin users are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels. As blockchains are increasingly being used as a record-keeping substrate for a variety of decentralized (financial technology) systems, our findings call for an urgent discussion on defining neutrality norms that miners must adhere to when ordering transactions in the chains.

This impedes system manageability, growth, and overall provisioning. In turn, large-scale content providers are forced to use staggering numbers of addresses, ultimately leading to address exhaustion (IPv4) and inefficiency (IPv6). In this paper, we revisit IP bindings, entirely. We attempt to evolve addressing conventions by decoupling IP in DNS and from network sockets. Alongside technologies such as SNI and ECMP, a new architecture emerges that ``unbinds'' IP from services and servers, thereby returning IP's role to merely that of reachability. The architecture is under evaluation at a major CDN in multiple datacenters. We show that addresses can be generated randomly \emph{per-query}, for 20M+ domains and services, from as few as ~4K addresses, 256 addresses, and even \emph{one} IP address. We explain why this approach is transparent to routing, L4/L7 load-balancers, distributed caching, and all surrounding systems -- and is \emph{highly desirable}. Our experience suggests that many network-oriented systems and services (e.g., route leak mitigation, denial of service, measurement) could be improved, and new ones designed, if built with addressing agility."

To date, there are few examples of companies that have transparently undertaken all three steps. In this paper we outline a framework for algorithmic auditing by way of a case-study of pymetrics, a startup that uses machine learning to recommend job candidates to their clients. We discuss how pymetrics approaches the question of fairness given the constraints of ethical, regulatory, and client demands, and how pymetrics' software implements adverse impact testing. We also present the results of an independent audit of pymetrics' candidate screening tool. We conclude with recommendations on how to structure audits to be practical, independent, and constructive, so that companies have better incentive to participate in third party audits, and that watchdog groups can be better prepared to investigate companies."

However, unlike other open marketplaces (e.g., AirBnB), Uber is a black-box: they do not provide data about supply or demand, and prices are set dynamically by an opaque ""surge pricing"" algorithm. The lack of transparency has led to concerns about whether Uber artificially manipulate prices, and whether dynamic prices are fair to customers and drivers. In order to understand the impact of surge pricing on passengers and drivers, we present the first in-depth investigation of Uber. We gathered four weeks of data from Uber by emulating 43 copies of the Uber smartphone app and distributing them throughout downtown San Francisco (SF) and midtown Manhattan. Using our dataset, we are able to characterize the dynamics of Uber in SF and Manhattan, as well as identify key implementation details of Uber's surge price algorithm. Our observations about Uber's surge price algorithm raise important questions about the fairness and transparency of this system."

DOI: 10.1145/2815675.2815691","Traffic differentiation---giving better (or worse) performance to certain classes of Internet traffic---is a well-known but poorly understood traffic management policy. There is active discussion on whether and how ISPs should be allowed to differentiate Internet traffic, but little data about current practices to inform this discussion. Previous work attempted to address this problem for fixed line networks; however, there is currently no solution that works in the more challenging mobile environment. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first system and mobile app for identifying traffic differentiation for arbitrary applications in the mobile environment (i.e., wireless networks such as cellular and WiFi, used by smartphones and tablets). The key idea is to use a VPN proxy to record and replay the network traffic generated by arbitrary applications, and compare it with the network behavior when replaying this traffic outside of an encrypted tunnel. We perform the first known testbed experiments with actual commercial shaping devices to validate our system design and demonstrate how it outperforms previous work for detecting differentiation. We released our app and collected differentiation results from 12 ISPs in 5 countries. We find that differentiation tends to affect TCP traffic (reducing rates by up to 60%) and that interference from middleboxes (including video-transcoding devices) is pervasive. By exposing such behavior, we hope to improve transparency for users and help inform future policies."

Administrators can define intents that capture the overall behavior they want from the network, and an IBN controller compiles such intents into low-level configurations that get installed in the network and implement the desired behavior. We discovered that current IBN specifications and implementations do not specify that flow rule installation orderings should be enforced, which leads to temporal vulnerabilities where, for a limited time, attackers can exploit indeterminate connectivity behavior to gain unauthorized network access. In this paper, we analyze the causes of such temporal vulnerabilities and their security impacts with a representative case study via the ONOS IBN implementation. We devise the Phantom Link attack and demonstrate a working exploit to highlight the security impacts. To defend against such attacks, we propose Spotlight, a detection method that can alert a system administrator of risky intent updates prone to exploitable temporal vulnerabilities. Spotlight is effective in identifying risky updates using realistic network topologies and policies. We show that Spotlight can detect risky updates in a mean time of 0.65 seconds for topologies of over 1,300 nodes."

There are multiple Lightning Network client implementations, all of which conform to the same textual specifications known as BOLTs. Several vulnerabilities have been manually discovered, but to-date there have been few works systematically analyzing the security of the Lightning Network. In this work, we take a foundational approach to analyzing the security of the Lightning Network with the help of formal methods. Based on the BOLTs' specifications, we build a detailed formal model of the Lightning Network's single-hop payment protocol and verify it using the Spin model checker. Our model captures both concurrency and error semantics of the payment protocol. We then define several security properties which capture the correct intermediate operation of the protocol, ensuring that the outcome is always certain to both channel peers, and using them we re-discover a known attack previously reported in the literature along with a novel attack, referred to as a Payout Race. A Payout Race consists of a particular sequence of events that can lead to an ambiguity in the protocol in which innocent users can unwittingly lose funds. We confirm the practicality of this attack by reproducing it in a local testbed environment."

Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks."

We evaluate the automatically extracted protocol rules by applying them to a state-of-the-art fuzzer for transport protocols and show that it leads to a smaller number of test cases while finding the same attacks as the system that uses manually specified rules."

However, apps introduce significant security challenges that can systemically disrupt network operations, since apps must access or modify data in a shared control plane state. If our understanding of how such data propagate within the control plane is inadequate, apps can co-opt other apps, causing them to poison the control plane's integrity. We present a class of SDN control plane integrity attacks that we call cross-app poisoning (CAP), in which an unprivileged app manipulates the shared control plane state to trick a privileged app into taking actions on its behalf. We demonstrate how role-based access control (RBAC) schemes are insufficient for preventing such attacks because they neither track information flow nor enforce information flow control (IFC). We also present a defense, ProvSDN, that uses data provenance to track information flow and serves as an online reference monitor to prevent CAP attacks. We implement ProvSDN on the ONOS SDN controller and demonstrate that information flow can be tracked with low-latency overheads."

We propose a theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models.

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Text written by humans makes up the vast majority of the data used to pre-train and fine-tune large language models (LLMs). Many sources of this data—like code, forum posts, personal websites, and books—are easily attributed to one or a few “users”. In this paper, we ask if it is possible to infer if any of a _user’s_ data was used to train an LLM. Not only would this constitute a breach of privacy, but it would also enable users to detect when their data was used for training. We develop the first effective attacks for _user inference_—at times, with near-perfect success—against LLMs. Our attacks are easy to employ, requiring only black-box access to an LLM and a few samples from the user, which _need not be the ones that were trained on_. We find, both theoretically and empirically, that certain properties make users more susceptible to user inference: being an outlier, having highly correlated examples, and contributing a larger fraction of data. Based on these findings, we identify several methods for mitigating user inference including training with example-level differential privacy, removing within-user duplicate examples, and reducing a user’s contribution to the training data. Though these provide partial mitigation, our work highlights the need to develop methods to fully protect LLMs from user inference."

These shortcomings make deploying such techniques at scale difficult in practice, especially in federated settings where model training can take days or weeks. In this work, we present a novel ""one-shot"" approach that can systematically address these challenges, allowing efficient auditing or estimation of the privacy loss of a model during the same, single training run used to fit model parameters, and without requiring any a priori knowledge about the model architecture, task, or DP training algorithm.

Most MI research focuses on the case of a single standalone model, while production machine-learning platforms often update models over time, on data that often shifts in distribution, giving the attacker more information. This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage of one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to leverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against the original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific ways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions and tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative justification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show that our attacks are effective at using update information to give the adversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also compared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a related machine-unlearning setting. We perform the first measurements of the impact of distribution shift on MI attacks with model updates, and show that a more drastic distribution shift results in significantly higher MI risk than a gradual shift. We also show that our attacks are effective at auditing differentially private fine tuning. We make our code public on Github: https://github.com/stanleykywu/model-updates.

Poisoning attacks against machine learning induce adversarial modification of data used by a machine learning algorithm to selectively change its output when it is deployed. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning attack called a subpopulation attack, which is particularly relevant when datasets are large and diverse. We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat."

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation."

In this paper, we perform the first systematic study of poisoning attacks and their countermeasures for linear regression models. In poisoning attacks, attackers deliberately influence the training data to manipulate the results of a predictive model. We propose a theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models. We also introduce a fast statistical attack that requires limited knowledge of the training process. Finally, we design a new principled defense method that is highly resilient against all poisoning attacks. We provide formal guarantees about its convergence and an upper bound on the effect of poisoning attacks when the defense is deployed. We evaluate extensively our attacks and defenses on three realistic datasets from health care, loan assessment, and real estate domains."

Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2021.","Closely monitoring the behavior of a software system during its execution enables developers and analysts to observe, and ultimately understand, how it works. This kind of dynamic analysis can be instrumental to reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, exploit development, and debugging. While these analyses are typically well-supported for homogeneous desktop platforms (e.g., x86 desktop PCs), they can rarely be applied in the heterogeneous world of embedded systems. One approach to enable dynamic analyses of embedded systems is to move software stacks from physical systems into virtual environments that sufficiently model hardware behavior. This process which we call ""rehosting"" poses a significant research challenge with major implications for security analyses. Although rehosting has traditionally been an unscientific and ad-hoc endeavor undertaken by domain experts with varying time and resources at their disposal, researchers are beginning to address rehosting challenges systematically and in earnest. In this paper, we establish that emulation is insufficient to conduct large-scale dynamic analysis of real-world hardware systems and present rehosting as a firmware-centric alternative. Furthermore, we taxonomize preliminary rehosting efforts, identify the fundamental components of the rehosting process, and propose directions for future research."

DOI: 10.1145/3433210.3453096","Fuzz testing has been used to find bugs in programs since the 1990s, but despite decades of dedicated research, there is still no consensus on which fuzzing techniques work best. One reason for this is the paucity of ground truth: bugs in real programs with known root causes and triggering inputs are difficult to collect at a meaningful scale. Bug injection technologies that add synthetic bugs into real programs seem to offer a solution, but the differences in finding these synthetic bugs versus organic bugs have not previously been explored at a large scale. Using over 80 years of CPU time, we ran eight fuzzers across 20 targets from the Rode0day bug-finding competition and the LAVA-M corpus. Experiments were standardized with respect to compute resources and metrics gathered. These experiments show differences in fuzzer performance as well as the impact of various configuration options. For instance, it is clear that integrating symbolic execution with mutational fuzzing is very effective and that using dictionaries improves performance. Other conclusions are less clear-cut; for example, no one fuzzer beat all others on all tests. It is noteworthy that no fuzzer found any organic bugs (i.e., one reported in a CVE), despite 50 such bugs being available for discovery in the fuzzing corpus. A close analysis of results revealed a possible explanation: a dramatic difference between where synthetic and organic bugs live with respect to the ""main path"" discovered by fuzzers. We find that recent updates to bug injection systems have made synthetic bugs more difficult to discover, but they are still significantly easier to find than organic bugs in our target programs. Finally, this study identifies flaws in bug injection techniques and suggests a number of axes along which synthetic bugs should be improved."

Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values."

One well-understood threat to privacy for such applications is the leakage of sensitive user information either in transit or at the server. In response, an array of defensive techniques have been developed to identify or block unintended or malicious information leakage. However, prior work has primarily considered privacy leaks originating at the client directed at the server, while leakage in the reverse direction -- from the server to the client -- is comparatively under-studied. The question of whether and to what degree this leakage constitutes a threat remains an open question. We answer this question in the affirmative with Hush, a technique for semi-automatically identifying Server-based InFormation OvershariNg (SIFON) vulnerabilities in multi-tier applications. In particular, the technique detects SIFON vulnerabilities using a heuristic that overshared sensitive information from server-side APIs will not be displayed by the application's user interface. The technique first performs a scalable static program analysis to screen applications for potential vulnerabilities, and then attempts to confirm these candidates as true vulnerabilities with a partially-automated dynamic analysis. Our evaluation over a large corpus of Android applications demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique by discovering several previously-unknown SIFON vulnerabilities in eight applications."

""A better method to analyze blockchain consistency."" Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2018.","The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol. To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous. The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains: Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider; We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols; We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction ""confirmed""; We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system; We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore ""balancing""-attack. In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages. We hope our techniques enable authors of future blockchain proposals to provide a more rigorous analysis of their schemes."

A user should be able to perform keyword searches over all the documents she has access to, including the ones that others shared with her. The contents of the documents, and the search queries, should remain private from the server. This setting was considered by Popa et al. (NSDI '14) who developed a new cryptographic primitive called Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (MKSE), together with an instantiation and an implementation within a system called Mylar, to address this goal. Unfortunately, Grubbs et al. (CCS '16) showed that the proposed MKSE definition fails to provide basic security guarantees, and that the Mylar system is susceptible to simple attacks. Most notably, if a malicious Alice colludes with the server and shares a document with an honest Bob then the privacy of all of Bob's search queries is lost. In this work we revisit the notion of MKSE and propose a new strengthened definition that rules out the above attacks. We then construct MKSE schemes meeting our definition. We first give a simple and efficient construction using only pseudorandom functions.

However, auditing a black-box system for bias can be challenging due to the lack of transparency in the model's internal workings. In many web applications, such as Yelp, it is challenging, if not impossible, to manipulate their inputs systematically to identify bias in the output. Yelp connects users and businesses, where users identify new businesses and simultaneously express their experiences through reviews. Yelp recommendation software moderates user-provided content by categorizing it into recommended and not-recommended sections. The recommended reviews, among other attributes, are used by Yelp's ranking algorithm to rank businesses in a neighborhood. Due to Yelp's substantial popularity and its high impact on local businesses' success, understanding the bias of its algorithms is crucial.This data-driven study, for the first time, investigates the bias of Yelp's business ranking and review recommendation system. We examine three hypotheses to assess if Yelp's recommendation software shows bias against reviews of less established users with fewer friends and reviews and if Yelp's business ranking algorithm shows bias against restaurants located in specific neighborhoods, particularly in hotspot regions, with specific demographic compositions. Our findings show that reviews of less-established users are disproportionately categorized as not-recommended. We also find a positive association between restaurants' location in hotspot regions and their average exposure. Furthermore, we observed some cases of severe disparity bias in cities where the hotspots are in neighborhoods with less demographic diversity or higher affluence and education levels."

While less controversial, such misinformation can severely impact companies’ reputations and revenues, and users’ online experiences. Recently, social media has also been increasingly used as a novel source of knowledgebase for extracting timely and relevant security threats, which are fed to the threat intelligence systems for better performance. However, with possible campaigns spreading false security threats, these systems can become vulnerable to poisoning attacks. In this work, we proposed novel approaches for detecting misinformation about cybersecurity and privacy threats on social media, focusing on two topics with different types of misinformation: phishing websites and Zoom’s security & privacy threats. We developed a framework for detecting inaccurate phishing claims on Twitter. Using this framework, we could label about 9% of URLs and 22% of phishing reports as misinformation. We also proposed another framework for detecting misinformation related to Zoom’s security and privacy threats on multiple platforms. Our classifiers showed great performance with more than 98% accuracy. Employing these classifiers on the posts from Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter, we found respectively that about 18%, 3%, 4%, and 3% of posts were misinformation. In addition, we studied the characteristics of misinformation posts, their authors, and their timelines, which helped us identify campaigns."

First, we obtain improved rates for finding stationary points of smooth non-convex empirical loss functions. Second, we specialize to quasar-convex functions, which generalize star-convex functions and arise in learning dynamical systems and training some neural nets. We achieve the optimal rate for this class. Third, we give an optimal algorithm for finding stationary points of functions satisfying the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition. For example, over-parameterized neural networks often satisfy this condition. Fourth, we provide new state-of-the-art rates for stationary points of non-convex population loss functions.

We design two learning algorithms that simultaneously promise differential privacy and equalized odds, a 'fairness' condition that corresponds to equalizing false positive and negative rates across protected groups. Our first algorithm is a private implementation of the equalized odds post-processing approach of [Hardt et al., 2016]. This algorithm is appealingly simple, but must be able to use protected group membership explicitly at test time, which can be viewed as a form of 'disparate treatment'. Our second algorithm is a differentially private version of the oracle-efficient in-processing approach of [Agarwal et al., 2018] that can be used to find the optimal fair classifier, given access to a subroutine that can solve the original (not necessarily fair) learning problem. This algorithm is more complex but need not have access to protected group membership at test time. We identify new tradeoffs between fairness, accuracy, and privacy that emerge only when requiring all three properties, and show that these tradeoffs can be milder if group membership may be used at test time. We conclude with a brief experimental evaluation."

Specifically, we characterize this sample complexity up to constant factors in terms of the structure ofPandQand the privacy levelε, and show that this sample complexity is achieved by a certain randomized and clamped variant of the log-likelihood ratio test. Our result is an analogue of the classical Neyman-Pearson lemma in the setting of private hypothesis testing. We also give an application of our result to the private change-point detection.

Specifically, we look at how best to design differentially private protocols in a distributed setting, where each user holds a private datum. The literature has mostly considered two models: the ""central"" model, in which a trusted server collects users' data in the clear, which allows greater accuracy; and the ""local"" model, in which users individually randomize their data, and need not trust the server, but accuracy is limited. Attempts to achieve the accuracy of the central model without a trusted server have so far focused on variants of cryptographic MPC, which limits scalability.In this paper, we initiate the analytic study of a shuffled model for distributed differentially private algorithms, which lies between the local and central models. This simple-to-implement model, a special case of the ESA framework of [Bittau et al., '17], augments the local model with an anonymous channel that randomly permutes a set of user-supplied messages. For sum queries, we show that this model provides the power of the central model while avoiding the need to trust a central server and the complexity of cryptographic secure function evaluation. More generally, we give evidence that the power of the shuffled model lies strictly between those of the central and local models: for a natural restriction of the model, we show that shuffled protocols for a widely studied selection problem require exponentially higher sample complexity than do central-model protocols."

Our extension allows us to prove lower bounds that depend on both the number of relevant queries and the total number of queries."

In Proceedings of The 28th Conference on Learning Theory (COLT’15), 2015","We show an essentially tight bound on the number of adaptively chosen statistical queries that a computationally efficient algorithm can answer accurately givennsamples from an unknown distribution. A statistical query asks for the expectation of a predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical query is accurate if it is ""close"" to the correct expectation over the distribution. This question was recently studied by Dwork et al., who showed how to answerΩ~(n2)queries efficiently, and also by Hardt and Ullman, who showed that answeringO~(n3)queries is hard. We close the gap between the two bounds and show that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient algorithm that, givennsamples from an unknown distribution, can give valid answers toO(n2)adaptively chosen statistical queries. An implication of our results is that computationally efficient algorithms for answering arbitrary, adaptively chosen statistical queries may as well be differentially private.We obtain our results using a new connection between the problem of answering adaptively chosen statistical queries and a combinatorial object called an interactive fingerprinting code. In order to optimize our hardness result, we give a new Fourier-analytic approach to analyzing fingerprinting codes that is simpler, more flexible, and yields better parameters than previous constructions."

In particular, we show (under a mild additional assumption) how to convert a BARG that generates proofs of length poly ( m )· k 1−є , where m is the length of a single instance and k is the number of instances being batched, into one that generates proofs of length poly ( m , log k ), which is the gold standard for succinctness of BARG s. By prior work, such BARG s imply the existence of SNARG s for deterministic time T computation with succinctness poly (log T ). Our result reduces the long-standing challenge of building publicly-verifiable delegation schemes to a much easier problem: building a batch argument system that beats the trivial construction. It also immediately implies new constructions of BARG s and SNARG s with polylogarithmic succinctness based on either bilinear maps or a combination of the DDH and QR assumptions. Along the way, we prove an equivalence between BARG s and a new notion of SNARG s for (deterministic) RAM computations that we call “ flexible RAM SNARG s with partial input soundness .” This is the first demonstration that SNARG s for deterministic computation (of any kind) imply BARG s. Our RAM SNARG notion is of independent interest and has already been used in a recent work on constructing rate-1 BARG s (Devadas et. ‍al. FOCS 2022)."

For each query, we analyze the top 15 results returned on both Google and Bing Images. Analysis of real-world image search queries produces multiple insights. First, less than 5% of unique queries are open-ended people queries. Second, fashion queries are, by far, the most common category of open-ended people queries, accounting for over 30% of the total. Third, the modal skin tone on the Monk Skin Tone scale is two out of ten (the second lightest) for images from both search engines.

DOI: 10.1145/3548606.3560594","This paper proposes using a logic programming language to disentangle X.509 certificate validation policy from mechanism. Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Hammurabi into Firefox and the Go language in less than 100 lines of code each."

Online services covered by the CCPA are required to provide a hyperlink on their homepage with the text “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” (DNSMPI). The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, a date that was chosen to give data collectors time to study the new law and bring themselves into compliance. In this study, we begin the process of investigating whether websites are complying with the CCPA by focusing on DNSMPI links. Using longitudinal data crawled from the top 1M websites in the Tranco ranking, we examine which websites are including DNSMPI links, whether the websites without DNSMPI links are out of compliance with the law, whether websites are using geofences to dynamically hide DNSMPI links from nonCalifornians, how DNSMPI adoption has changed over time, and how websites are choosing to present DNSMPI links (e.g., in terms of font size, color, and placement). We argue that the answers to these questions are critical for spurring enforcement actions under the law, and helping to shape future privacy laws and regulations, e.g., rule making that will soon commence around the successor to the CCPA, known as the CPRA."

In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of mobile application, mobile browser, and web browser versions of 105 popular services to investigate variations in dark patterns across modalities. We perform manual tests, identify dark patterns in each service, and examine how they persist or differ by modality. Our findings show that while services can employ some dark patterns equally across modalities, many dark patterns vary between platforms, and that these differences saddle people with inconsistent experiences of autonomy, privacy, and control. We conclude by discussing broader implications for policymakers and practitioners, and provide suggestions for furthering dark patterns research."

Achieving this goal, however, is complex: the developer must (1) deeply engage with social and legal facets of ""fairness"" in a given context, (2) develop software that concretizes these values, and (3) undergo an independent algorithm audit to ensure technical correctness and social accountability of their algorithms. To date, there are few examples of companies that have transparently undertaken all three steps. In this paper we outline a framework for algorithmic auditing by way of a case-study of pymetrics, a startup that uses machine learning to recommend job candidates to their clients. We discuss how pymetrics approaches the question of fairness given the constraints of ethical, regulatory, and client demands, and how pymetrics' software implements adverse impact testing. We also present the results of an independent audit of pymetrics' candidate screening tool. We conclude with recommendations on how to structure audits to be practical, independent, and constructive, so that companies have better incentive to participate in third party audits, and that watchdog groups can be better prepared to investigate companies."

Existing studies on this topic have hitherto adopted a coarse concept of misinformation, which incorporates a broad spectrum of story types ranging from political conspiracies to misinterpreted pranks. This paper aims to structurize these misinformation stories by leveraging fact-check articles. Our intuition is that key phrases in a fact-check article that identify the misinformation type(s) (e.g., doctored images, urban legends) also act as rationales that determine the verdict of the fact-check (e.g., false). We experiment on rationalized models with domain knowledge as weak supervision to extract these phrases as rationales, and then cluster semantically similar rationales to summarize prevalent misinformation types. Using archived fact-checks from Snopes.com, we identify ten types of misinformation stories. We discuss how these types have evolved over the last ten years and compare their prevalence between the 2016/2020 US presidential elections and the H1N1/COVID-19 pandemics."

These consequences are framed under the public's susceptibility to such misinformation — a narrative that needs further investigation and quantification. To this end, our paper proposes an observational approach to model and measure expressed (dis)beliefs in (mis)information by leveraging social media comments as a proxy. We collect a sample of tweets in response to (mis)information and annotate them with (dis)belief labels, explore the dataset using lexicon-based methods, and finally build classifiers based on the state-of-the-art neural transfer-learning models (BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa). Under a domain-specific thresholding strategy for unbiasedness, the best-performing classifier archives macro-F 1 scores around 0.86 for disbelief and 0.80 for belief. Applying the classifier, we conduct a large-scale measurement study and show that, for true/mixed/false claims on social media, 12%/14%/15% of comments express disbelief and 26%/21%/20% of comments express belief. In addition, our results suggest an extremely slight time effect of falsehood awareness, a positive effect of fact-checks to false claims, and differences in (dis)belief across social media platforms."

However, programmatic advertising has also given rise to a novel form of ad fraud known as domain spoofing, in which attackers sell counterfeit impressions that claim to be from high-value publishers. To mitigate domain spoofing, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab introduced the ads.txt standard in May 2017 to help ad buyers verify authorized digital ad sellers, as well as to promote overall transparency in programmatic advertising. In this work, we present a 15-month longitudinal, observational study of the ads.txt standard. We do this to understand (1) if it is helping ad buyers to combat domain spoofing and (2) whether the transparency offered by the standard can provide useful data to researchers and privacy advocates. With respect to halting domain spoofing, we observe that over 60% of Alexa Top-100K publishers that run RTB ads have adopted ads.txt, and that ad exchanges and advertisers appear to be honoring the standard. With respect to transparency, the widespread adoption of ads.txt allows us to explicitly identify over 1,000 domains belonging to ad exchanges, without having to rely on crowdsourcing or heuristic methods. However, we also find that ads.txt is still a long way from reaching its full potential. Many publishers have yet to adopt the standard, and we observe major ad exchanges purchasing unauthorized impressions that violate the standard. This opens the door to domain spoofing attacks. Further, ads.txt data often include errors that must be cleaned and mitigated before the data is practically useful."

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size."

However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs. We implemented this approach in NNSmith which has found 72 new bugs for TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch to date.

To tame these undefined behaviors, we introduce a framework ouroboros, which builds verified NNs that follow user-defined specifications. These specifications comprise input and output constraints which characterize the behaviors of a NN. We do a case study on database learned indexes to demonstrate that training verified NN models is possible.

The core technical challenge is that the underlying search problem is computationally expensive. COBRA tames that problem by starting with a suitable SMT solver. COBRA then introduces several new techniques, including a new encoding of the validity condition; hardware acceleration to prune inputs to the solver; and a transaction segmentation mechanism that enables scaling and garbage collection.

TokenScout: Early Detection of Ethereum Scam Tokens via Temporal Graph Learning CCS, 956-970. https://doi.org/10.1145/3658644.3690234","Decentralized finance has experienced phenomenal growth, revolutionizing the landscape of financial transactions and asset management via blockchain. Yet, this swift growth brings with it substantial challenges, notably the surge in scam tokens, imposing significant security threats on cryptocurrency investments and trading. Existing detection methods of scam token, primarily relying on analyzing contract codes or transaction patterns, struggle to catch increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by scammers. For example, contract-based analysis are unable to identify scams lacking overt malicious code, e.g., most rugpulls, while transaction-based methods generally lack the foresight to early-detect potential risks. In this paper, we present TokenScout, the first temporal temporal graph neural network-based framework for scam token early detection. TokenScout formulates token transfer data as a dynamic temporal attributed multigraph and leverages the temporal graph learning model to learn graph representations. It also builds a graph representation refining model based on contrastive learning to learn a more discriminative representation space for risk identification. We evaluated TokenScout using a comprehensive dataset of 214,084 standard ERC20 tokens from 2015 to February 2023. TokenScout achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.41%. Additionally, from March to May 2023, deploying TokenScout on Ethereum effectively identified 706 rugpulls, 174 honeypots, and 90 Ponzi schemes, thereby alerting to potential risks exceeding 240 million."

One approach to prevent such attacks is to enforce control-flow integrity (CFI), but inlined CFI enforcement can pose challenges in embedded systems. For example, it increases binary size and changes memory layout. Trace-based control-flow violation detection (CFVD) offers an alternative that doesn't require instrumentation of the protected software or changes to its memory layout. However, existing CFVD methods used in desktop systems require kernel modifications to store and analyze the trace, which limits their use to monitoring unprivileged applications. But, embedded systems are interrupt-driven, with the majority of processing taking place in the privileged mode. Therefore, it is critical to provide a holistic and system-oriented CFVD solution that can monitor control-flow transfers both within and among privileged and unprivileged components. In this paper, we present SHERLOC, a Secure and Holistic Control-Flow Violation Detection mechanism designed for microcontroller-based embedded systems. SHERLOC ensures security by configuring the hardware tracing unit, storing trace records, and executing the violation detection algorithm in a trusted execution environment, which prevents privileged programs from bypassing monitoring or tampering with the trace. We address the challenges of achieving holistic and system-oriented CFVD by formalizing the problem and monitoring forward and backward edges of unprivileged and privileged programs, as well as control-flow transfers among unprivileged and privileged components. Specifically, SHERLOC overcomes the challenges of identifying legitimate asynchronous interrupts and context switches at run-time by using an interrupt- and scheduling-aware violation detection algorithm. Our evaluations on the ARMv8-M architecture demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SHERLOC."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

Acquiring such data is often a challenge, particularly in specialized fields like medical, legal, and financial sectors. Those are commonly referred to as low-resource domains, which comprise long-tail entities, due to the scarcity of available data. To address this, data augmentation techniques are increasingly being employed to generate additional training instances from the original dataset. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of two prominent text augmentation techniques, Mention Replacement and Contextual Word Replacement, on two widely-used NER models, Bi-LSTM+CRF and BERT. We conduct experiments on four datasets from low-resource domains, and we explore the impact of various combinations of training subset sizes and number of augmented examples. We not only confirm that data augmentation is particularly beneficial for smaller datasets, but we also demonstrate that there is no universally optimal number of augmented examples, i.e., NER practitioners must experiment with different quantities in order to fine-tune their projects."

In recent years, the use of mobility data has demonstrated significant impact in various domains including traffic management, urban planning, and health sciences. In this paper, we present the emerging domain of mobility data science. Towards a unified approach to mobility data science, we envision a pipeline having the following components: mobility data collection, cleaning, analysis, management, and privacy. For each of these components, we explain how mobility data science differs from general data science, we survey the current state of the art and describe open challenges for the research community in the coming years."

Even though unabstracted game trees can lead to optimal policies, due to real-time constraints and the tree size, they are not a practical choice. In this context, we introduce an action abstraction scheme which we call asymmetric action abstraction. Asymmetric abstractions allow search algorithms to “pay more attention” to some aspects of the game by unevenly dividing the algorithm’s search effort amongst different aspects of the game. We also introduce four algorithms that search in asymmetrically abstracted game trees to evaluate the effectiveness of our abstraction schemes. Two of our algorithms are adaptations of algorithms developed for searching in action-abstracted spaces, Portfolio Greedy Search and Stratified Strategy Selection, and the other two are adaptations of an algorithm developed for searching in unabstracted spaces, NaïveMCTS. An extensive set of experiments in a real-time strategy game shows that search algorithms using asymmetric abstractions are able to outperform all other search algorithms tested."

This seminar was held January 9-14, 2022, including 47 participants from industry and academia. The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to create a new research community of mobility data science in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts by bringing together established leaders as well as promising young researchers from all fields related to mobility data science. Specifically, this report summarizes the main results of the seminar by (1) defining Mobility Data Science as a research domain, (2) by sketching its agenda in the coming years, and by (3) building a mobility data science community. (1) Mobility data science is defined as spatiotemporal data that additionally captures the behavior of moving entities (human, vehicle, animal, etc.). To understand, explain, and predict behavior, we note that a strong collaboration with research in behavioral and social sciences is needed. (2) Future research directions for mobility data science described in this report include a) mobility data acquisition and privacy, b) mobility data management and analysis, and c) applications of mobility data science.

Our solution consists of linear programs that solve the problems exactly and can be implemented using MILP solvers. These solvers also support additional constraints on the scoring function, allowing the user to explore competing hypotheses through alternative scoring functions. We also discuss techniques for dealing with numerical imprecision and for improving performance and scalability. Experiments demonstrate that RankExplain can solve realistic problems.

We begin with lexicographic orderings and give a decidable characterization (under conventional complexity assumptions) of the class of tractable lexicographic orderings for every CQ without self-joins. We then continue to the more general orderings by the sum of attribute weights and show for it that ranked direct access is tractable only in trivial cases. Hence, to better understand the computational challenge at hand, we consider the more modest task of providing access to only a single answer (i.e., finding the answer at a given position) - a task that we refer to as the selection problem. We indeed achieve a quasilinear-time algorithm for a subset of the class of full CQs without self-joins, by adopting a solution of Frederickson and Johnson to the classic problem of selection over sorted matrices. We further prove that none of the other queries in this class admit such an algorithm."

Our main contribution is a framework for ranked enumeration over a class of dynamic programming problems that generalizes seemingly different problems that had been studied in isolation. To this end, we extend classic algorithms that find the k -shortest paths in a weighted graph. For full conjunctive queries, including cyclic ones, our approach is optimal in terms of the time to return the top result and the delay between results. These optimality properties are derived for the widely used notion of data complexity, which treats query size as a constant. By performing a careful cost analysis, we are able to uncover a previously unknown tradeoff between two incomparable enumeration approaches: one has lower complexity when the number of returned results is small, the other when the number is very large. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the superiority of our techniques over batch algorithms, which produce the full result and then sort it. Our technique is not only faster for returning the first few results, but on some inputs beats the batch algorithm even when all results are produced."

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size."

Bugs in these compilers can result in models whose semantics differ from the original ones, producing incorrect results that corrupt the correctness of downstream applications. However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs. We implemented this approach in NNSmith which has found 72 new bugs for TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch to date.

The core technical challenge is that the underlying search problem is computationally expensive. COBRA tames that problem by starting with a suitable SMT solver. COBRA then introduces several new techniques, including a new encoding of the validity condition; hardware acceleration to prune inputs to the solver; and a transaction segmentation mechanism that enables scaling and garbage collection. Cobra imposes modest overhead on clients, improves over baselines by 10× in verification cost, and (unlike the baselines) supports continuous verification.

It further introduces an algorithm for high accuracy link failure inference that is resilient to real-world data inconsistency by integrating both our troubleshooting domain knowledge and machine learning techniques. NetBouncer has been deployed in Microsoft Azure's data centers for three years. And in practice, it produced no false positives and only a few false negatives so far."

People are fascinated by its promise that users can truly own their data. However, in a decentralized Internet, completing a task usually involves multiple nodes with mutual distrust. Such distrust might eventually become a major obstacle for the growth of the decentralized Internet. In this paper, we analyze the distrust using a simple model and highlight the properties required to faithfully accomplish one task in a decentralized Internet. We also introduce our draft solution -- PIXIU, a framework to mitigate the distrust among different nodes. In PIXIU, we design and utilize trust-{\lambda} and decentralized executor to achieve the above-needed properties."

To address this, we introduce PLANT -- Pretrained and Leveraged AtteNTion -- a novel transfer learning strategy for fine-tuning XMTC decoders. PLANT surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods across all metrics on mimicfull, mimicfifty, mimicfour, eurlex, and wikiten datasets. It particularly excels in few-shot scenarios, outperforming previous models specifically designed for few-shot scenarios by over 50 percentage points in F1 scores on mimicrare and by over 36 percentage points on mimicfew, demonstrating its superior capability in handling rare codes. PLANT also shows remarkable data efficiency in few-shot scenarios, achieving precision comparable to traditional models with significantly less data. These results are achieved through key technical innovations: leveraging a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model as the planted attention layer, integrating mutual-information gain to enhance attention, introducing an inattention mechanism, and implementing a stateful-decoder to maintain context. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the importance of these contributions in realizing the performance gains."

We demonstrate that our algorithm is well suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present an adaptation of RNN sequence models to the problem of multi-label classification for text, where the target is a set of labels, not a sequence. Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task."

At small to medium scales, we present a novel combination of existing methods with some new theoretical justification. For very large values of n optimizing over an entire embedding breaks down, so we propose a novel method which first embeds a subset of m << n objects and then embeds the remaining objects independently and in parallel. We prove a distance error bound for our method in terms of m and that it has O(dn log m) time complexity, and show empirically that it is able to produce high quality embeddings in a fraction of the time needed for any published method."

For each assessor, we model assessor quality and bias in the form of Gaussian distributed class conditionals of relevance grades. For each document, we model true relevance and difficulty as continuous variables. We estimate all parameters from crowdsourced data, demonstrating better inference of relevance as well as realistic models for both documents and assessors.

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes.

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

To explore the degree to which this capability has materialized, we extract meta-data from 356,403 clinical trials spanning four decades, aiming to offer mechanistic insights into the innovation practices in drug discovery. We find that convention dominates over innovation, as over 96% of the recorded trials focus on previously tested drug targets, and the tested drugs target only 12% of the human interactome. If current patterns persist, it would take 170 years to target all druggable proteins. We uncover two network-based fundamental mechanisms that currently limit target discovery: preferential attachment, leading to the repeated exploration of previously targeted proteins; and local network effects, limiting exploration to proteins interacting with highly explored proteins. We build on these insights to develop a quantitative network-based model of drug discovery. We demonstrate that the model is able to accurately recreate the exploration patterns observed in clinical trials. Most importantly, we show that a network-based search strategy can widen the scope of drug discovery by guiding exploration to novel proteins that are part of under explored regions in the human interactome."

While deep learning models have been proposed to accelerate the identification process, we show that state-of-the-art models fail to generalize to novel (i.e., never-before-seen) structures. We first unveil the mechanisms responsible for this shortcoming, demonstrating how models rely on shortcuts that leverage the topology of the protein-ligand bipartite network, rather than learning the node features. Then, we introduce AI-Bind, a pipeline that combines network-based sampling strategies with unsupervised pre-training, allowing us to limit the annotation imbalance and improve binding predictions for novel proteins and ligands. We illustrate the value of AI-Bind by predicting drugs and natural compounds with binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and the associated human proteins. We also validate these predictions via docking simulations and comparison with recent experimental evidence, and step up the process of interpreting machine learning prediction of protein-ligand binding by identifying potential active binding sites on the amino acid sequence. Overall, AI-Bind offers a powerful high-throughput approach to identify drug-target combinations, with the potential of becoming a powerful tool in drug discovery."

We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions. We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules. Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. Our investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width and deeper GCNs are more capable of learning higher order graph moments. Additionally, combining GCN modules with different propagation rules is critical to the representation power of GCNs."

The assembly of active molecules might have promoted the formation of large pre-biotic polymers that could be the precursors of the informational polymers we observe nowadays. Numerical simulations clearly show that self-propulsion considerably speeds up the assembly of polymers, somewhat in agreement with previous related studies. We conclude by discussing the differences between self-Assembly and self-Organization and discuss the role of self-propelled particles in the development of the self-organized system.

In the U.S. call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255. We show how a model that borrows some of these ideas can be used to study polymer formation from a collection of self-propelled monomers. We will not attempt to provide a theoretical description of the active self-assembly process presented here. Instead, we will present only numerical results obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. The motivation for studying the channel system is based on the hypothesis that the formation of organic macro-molecules relevant to the origin of life may have occurred in micro-channels formed either in meteorites [ 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ] or in confined micro-spaces of marine vent chimneys in which molecules are driven by thermal gradients. The results show that the external input of energy, via self-propulsion or other sources (such as ATP), can considerably enhance the assembly of structures. Propulsion considerably improves theassembly of molecules as compared to spontaneous self-assembly. At high temperatures, mostly monomers and dimers coexist, whereas longer polymer appear in negligible amounts. At low temperatures, the average polymer length does not reach a maximum at any value of the self-propulsion force. This is due to the aggregation of molecules and polymers next to the repulsive channel walls, which decreases the rate at which the chains grow. In the high-temperature regime, the system reaches a stationary state within the simulation time. In every case reported in Figure 4 , it can be seen that increasing 𝐹 sp F sp increases the growth rate of the polymer chains. The tail of the distribution reveals that much longer polymers are created. The narrower the channel, the less self- Propulsion force is needed to create long polymers. This effect clearly becomes stronger for narrow channels. The aggregation and jammingof active particles next to the confining Walls has been observed in both numerical simulations and experiments. Self-propulsion could have been an important mechanism for the formation of pre-biotic structures or the synthesis of nanometric structures. The model we have introduced takes into account the full geometry of the molecules by discretizing them into subunits. All authors have read and agree to the published version of the manuscript.

Figure 6 shows the average chain length in a channel with semi-periodic boundary conditions. Almost all the points fall above the identity line, which means that the polymers formed in the channel are considerably longer than the ones observed in the bulk.

Customary diagnostics for these models are limited because they involve difficult‐to‐interpret residuals and often focus on the fit of one category versus the rest. Our residuals account for associations between categories by using the squared Mahalanobis distances of the observed log‐odds relative to their fitted sampling distributions. Aside from sampling variation, these residuals are exactly normal when the data come from the fitted model. This motivates our use of the residuals to detect model misspecification and overdispersion, in addition to an overall goodness‐of‐fit Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. We illustrate the use of the residuals and diagnostics in both simulation and real data studies."

As a result, most prediction models are the proprietary property of team or industrial sports entities, and little is known about them. Of those models that have been published, the main focus has been to separately model each outcome with nearly no emphasis on uncertainty quantification. This research introduces a joint modeling approach to predict seasonal plate appearance outcome vectors using a mixed-effects multinomial logistic-normal model. This model accounts for positive and negative correlations between outcomes, both across and within player seasons, and provides a joint posterior predictive outcome distribution from which uncertainty can be quantified. It is applied to the important, yet unaddressed, problem of predicting performance for players moving between the Japanese (NPB) and American (MLB) major leagues."

Effective monitoring of a coupled multidisciplinary system is crucial for real-time assessment of the interactions between various disciplines within the system. This monitoring provides the data necessary for detecting and addressing issues in a timely manner and facilitates adaptive decision-making for taking reliable design or control actions. However, processing and analyzing data in real time is computationally intensive, and limited resources, such as computational power, sensor capabilities, and budget, may constrain the extent to which a system can be monitored comprehensively. To address this, this article develops a particle-based approach that dynamically selects a subset of sensors that provides the highest information about the state of the system in real time. The proposed approach first predicts the amount of uncertainty in the estimation of the state of the system given noisy measurements from different subsets of available sensors. Then, it selects the sensors that reduce this uncertainty the most, enhancing the precision and efficiency of the monitoring process. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated via two coupled multidisciplinary systems in the numerical experiments."

These subsystems, referred to as disciplines, contain many types of uncertainty and in many cases are feedback-coupled with each other. In designing these complex systems, one needs to assess the stationary behavior of these systems for the sake of stability and reliability. This requires the system level uncertainty analysis of the multidisciplinary systems, which is often computationally intractable. To overcome this issue, techniques have been developed for capturing the stationary behavior of the coupled multidisciplinary systems through available data of individual disciplines. The accuracy and convergence of the existing techniques depend on a large amount of data from all disciplines, which are not available in many practical problems. Toward this, we have developed an adaptive methodology that adds the minimum possible number of samples from individual disciplines to achieve an accurate and reliable uncertainty propagation in coupled multidisciplinary systems. The proposed method models each discipline function via Gaussian process (GP) regression to derive a closed-form policy. This policy sequentially selects a new sample point that results in the highest uncertainty reduction over the distribution of the coupling design variables. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in the uncertainty analysis of an aerostructural system and a coupled numerical example."

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques, also known as particle methods, are a well-known class of parameter estimation methods for this general class of state-space models. Existing SMC-based techniques rely on excessive sampling of the parameter space, which makes their computation intractable for large systems or tall data sets. Bayesian optimization techniques have been used for fast inference in state-space models with intractable likelihoods. These techniques aim to find the maximum of the likelihood function by sequential sampling of the parameter space through a single SMC approximator. Various SMC approximators with different fidelities and computational costs are often available for sample-based likelihood approximation. In this paper, we propose a multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization algorithm for the inference of general nonlinear state-space models (MFBO-SSM), which enables simultaneous sequential selection of parameters and approximators. The accuracy and speed of the algorithm are demonstrated by numerical experiments using synthetic gene expression data from a gene regulatory network model and real data from the VIX stock price index."

Most of the existing adaptive controllers for MDPs with unknown dynamics are based on the reinforcement learning framework and rely on large data sets acquired by sustained direct interaction with the system or via a simulator. This is not feasible in many applications, due to ethical, economic, and physical constraints. The proposed framework addresses the data poverty issue by decomposing the problem into an offline planning stage that does not rely on sustained direct interaction with the system or simulator and an online execution stage. In the offline process, parallel Gaussian process temporal difference (GPTD) learning techniques are employed for near-optimal Bayesian approximation of the expected discounted reward over a sample drawn from the prior distribution of unknown parameters. In the online stage, the action with the maximum expected return with respect to the posterior distribution of the parameters is selected. This is achieved by an approximation of the posterior distribution using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, followed by constructing multiple Gaussian processes over the parameter space for efficient prediction of the means of the expected return at the MCMC sample. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated using a simple dynamical system model with continuous state and action spaces, as well as a more complex model for a metastatic melanoma gene regulatory network observed through noisy synthetic gene expression data."

In this work, we explore an alternative perspective by augmenting reactive reviews with proactive forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new concept text toxicity propensity to characterize the extent to which a text tends to attract toxic comments. Beta regression is then introduced to do the probabilistic modeling, which is demonstrated to function well in comprehensive experiments. We also propose an explanation method to communicate the model decision clearly. Both propensity scoring and interpretation benefit text moderation in a novel manner. Finally, the proposed scaling mechanism for the linear model offers useful insights beyond this work."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present our HABERTOR model for detecting hatespeech in large scale user-generated content. Inspired by the recent success of the BERT model, we propose several modifications to BERT to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification task. HABERTOR inherits BERT’s architecture, but is different in four aspects: (i) it generates its own vocabularies and is pre-trained from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech dataset; (ii) it consists of Quaternion-based factorized components, resulting in a much smaller number of parameters, faster training and inferencing, as well as less memory usage; (iii) it uses our proposed multi-source ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input sources, to further enhance its effectiveness; and (iv) it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed fine-grained and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its robustness. Through experiments on the large-scale real-world hatespeech dataset with 1.4M annotated comments, we show that HABERTOR works better than 15 state-of-the-art hatespeech detection methods, including fine-tuning Language Models. In particular, comparing with BERT, our HABERTOR is 4 5 times faster in the training/inferencing phase, uses less than 1/3 of the memory, and has better performance, even though we pre-train it by using less than 1% of the number of words. Our generalizability analysis shows that HABERTOR transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to BERT for the hatespeech classification."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract The neural attention mechanism plays an important role in many natural language processing applications. In particular, multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. However, without explicit constraining, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model’s representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective. Based on the recently developed particle-optimization sampling techniques, we propose a non-parametric approach that explicitly improves the repulsiveness in multi-head attention and consequently strengthens model’s expressiveness. Remarkably, our Bayesian interpretation provides theoretical inspirations on the not-well-understood questions: why and how one uses multi-head attention. Extensive experiments on various attention models and applications demonstrate that the proposed repulsive attention can improve the learned feature diversity, leading to more informative representations with consistent performance improvement on multiple tasks."

Inspired by the masking strategy and text normalization, TNT is developed to learn language representation by training transformers to reconstruct text from four operation types typically seen in text manipulation: substitution, transposition, deletion, and insertion. Furthermore, the normalization involves the prediction of both operation types and token labels, enabling TNT to learn from more challenging tasks than the standard task of masked word recovery. As a result, the experiments demonstrate that TNT outperforms strong baselines on the hate speech classification task. Additional text normalization experiments and case studies show that TNT is a new potential approach to misspelling correction."

This new resource was derived from a panel of over 1.5 million Twitter users matched against their U.S. voter registration records, facilitating a better understanding of a decade of information flows on one of the most prominent social media platforms and trends in political and public discourse among registered U.S. voters from different sociodemographic groups. By aggregating user demographic information onto the domains, we derive five metrics that provide critical insights into over 129,000 websites. In particular, the localness and partisan audience metrics quantify the domains' geographical reach and ideological orientation, respectively. These metrics show substantial agreement with existing classifications, suggesting the effectiveness and reliability of DomainDemo's approach."

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption."

These approaches fail to capture another potential form of misinformation with a much larger audience: factual news from mainstream sources ('real' news) repurposed to promote false or misleading narratives. We operationalize narratives using an existing unsupervised NLP technique and examine the narratives present in misinformation content. We find that certain articles from reliable outlets are shared by a disproportionate number of users who also shared fake news on Twitter. We consider these 'real' news articles to be co-shared with fake news. We show that co-shared articles contain existing misinformation narratives at a significantly higher rate than articles from the same reliable outlets that are not co-shared with fake news. This holds true even when articles are chosen following strict criteria of reliability for the outlets and after accounting for the alternative explanation of partisan curation of articles. For example, we observe that a recent article published by The Washington Post titled ""Vaccinated people now make up a majority of COVID deaths"" was disproportionately shared by Twitter users with a history of sharing anti-vaccine false news reports. Our findings suggest a strategic repurposing of mainstream news by conveyors of misinformation as a way to enhance the reach and persuasiveness of misleading narratives. We also conduct a comprehensive case study to help highlight how such repurposing can happen on Twitter as a consequence of the inclusion of particular narratives in the framing of mainstream news."

Engagement Outweighs Exposure to Partisan and Unreliable News within Google Search CoRR, abs/2201.00074. https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00074","If popular online platforms systematically expose their users to partisan and unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues like rising political polarization. This concern is central to the echo chamber and filter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information sources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the URLs seen while using an online platform, and engagement, the URLs selected while on that platform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of obtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their regular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data, or estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their centrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have focused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and engagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. We found that participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent relationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed to on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results they chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall engagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed to on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news sources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall. These results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable news on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by users' own choices."

Abstract Stance detection, which aims to determine whether an individual is for or against a target concept, promises to uncover public opinion from large streams of social media data. Yet even human annotation of social media content does not always capture “stance” as measured by public opinion polls. We demonstrate this by directly comparing an individual’s self-reported stance to the stance inferred from their social media data. Leveraging a longitudinal public opinion survey with respondent Twitter handles, we conducted this comparison for 1,129 individuals across four salient targets. We find that recall is high for both “Pro’’ and “Anti’’ stance classifications but precision is variable in a number of cases. We identify three factors leading to the disconnect between text and author stance: temporal inconsistencies, differences in constructs, and measurement errors from both survey respondents and annotators. By presenting a framework for assessing the limitations of stance detection models, this work provides important insight into what stance detection truly measures."

We conduct experiments on four datasets from low-resource domains, and we explore the impact of various combinations of training subset sizes and number of augmented examples. We not only confirm that data augmentation is particularly beneficial for smaller datasets, but we also demonstrate that there is no universally optimal number of augmented examples, i.e., NER practitioners must experiment with different quantities in order to fine-tune their projects."

In this context, we introduce an action abstraction scheme which we call asymmetric action abstraction. Asymmetric abstractions allow search algorithms to “pay more attention” to some aspects of the game by unevenly dividing the algorithm’s search effort amongst different aspects of the game. We also introduce four algorithms that search in asymmetrically abstracted game trees to evaluate the effectiveness of our abstraction schemes. Two of our algorithms are adaptations of algorithms developed for searching in action-abstracted spaces, Portfolio Greedy Search and Stratified Strategy Selection, and the other two are adaptations of an algorithm developed for searching in unabstracted spaces, NaïveMCTS. An extensive set of experiments in a real-time strategy game shows that search algorithms using asymmetric abstractions are able to outperform all other search algorithms tested."

To aid biological discovery with XL-MS/MS, it is essential that pairs of chemically linked peptides be accurately identified, a process that requires: (i) database search, that creates a ranked list of candidate peptide pairs for each experimental spectrum and (ii) false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, that determines the probability of a false match in a group of top-ranked peptide pairs with scores above a given threshold. Currently, the only available FDR estimation mechanism in XL-MS/MS is the target-decoy approach (TDA). However, despite its simplicity, TDA has both theoretical and practical limitations that impact the estimation accuracy and increase run time over potential decoy-free approaches (DFAs). Results We introduce a novel decoy-free framework for FDR estimation in XL-MS/MS. Our approach relies on multi-sample mixtures of skew normal distributions, where the latent components correspond to the scores of correct peptide pairs (both peptides identified correctly), partially incorrect peptide pairs (one peptide identified correctly, the other incorrectly), and incorrect peptide pairs (both peptides identified incorrectly). To learn these components, we exploit the score distributions of first- and second-ranked peptide-spectrum matches for each experimental spectrum and subsequently estimate FDR using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm with constraints. We evaluate the method on ten datasets and provide evidence that the proposed DFA is theoretically sound and a viable alternative to TDA owing to its good performance in terms of accuracy, variance of estimation, and run time.

Well-estimated class priors are key to accurate approximation of posterior distributions and are necessary for the recovery of true classification performance. While significant progress has been made in the past decade, there remains a need for accurate strategies that scale to big data. Motivated by this need, we propose an intuitive and fast nonparametric algorithm to estimate class proportions. Unlike any of the previous methods, our algorithm uses a sampling strategy to repeatedly (1) draw an example from the set of positives, (2) record the minimum distance to any of the unlabeled examples, and (3) remove the nearest unlabeled example. We show that the point of sharp increase in the recorded distances corresponds to the desired proportion of positives in the unlabeled set and train a deep neural network to identify that point. Our distance-based algorithm is evaluated on forty datasets and compared to all currently available methods. We provide evidence that this new approach results in the most accurate performance and can be readily used on large datasets."

Although classification has been extensively studied over the past decades, there remain understudied problems when the training data violate the main statistical assumptions relied upon for accurate learning and model characterization. This particularly holds true in the open world setting where observations of a phenomenon generally guarantee its presence but the absence of such evidence cannot be interpreted as the evidence of its absence. Learning from such data is often referred to as positive-unlabeled learning, a form of semi-supervised learning where all labeled data belong to one (say, positive) class. To improve the best practices in the field, we here study the quality of estimated performance in positive-unlabeled learning in the biomedical domain. We provide evidence that such estimates can be wildly inaccurate, depending on the fraction of positive examples in the unlabeled data and the fraction of negative examples mislabeled as positives in the labeled data. We then present correction methods for four such measures and demonstrate that the knowledge or accurate estimates of class priors in the unlabeled data and noise in the labeled data are sufficient for the recovery of true classification performance. We provide theoretical support as well as empirical evidence for the efficacy of the new performance estimation methods.

Enumerating consistent sub-graphs of directed acyclic graphs: an insight into biomedical ontologies. Bioinformatics (2018) 34(13): i313-i322.","Abstract Motivation: Modern problems of concept annotation associate an object of interest (gene, individual, text document) with a set of interrelated textual descriptors (functions, diseases, topics), often organized in concept hierarchies or ontologies. Most ontology can be seen as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent concepts and edges represent relational ties between these concepts. Given an ontology graph, each object can only be annotated by a consistent sub-graph; that is, a sub-graph such that if an object is annotated by a particular concept, it must also be annotated by all other concepts that generalize it. Ontologies therefore provide a compact representation of a large space of possible consistent sub-graphs; however, until now we have not been aware of a practical algorithm that can enumerate such annotation spaces for a given ontology. Results: We propose an algorithm for enumerating consistent sub-graphs of DAGs. The algorithm recursively partitions the graph into strictly smaller graphs until the resulting graph becomes a rooted tree (forest), for which a linear-time solution is computed. It then combines the tallies from graphs created in the recursion to obtain the final count. We prove the correctness of this algorithm, propose several practical accelerations, evaluate it on random graphs and then apply it to characterize four major biomedical ontologies. We believe this work provides valuable insights into the complexity of concept annotation spaces and its potential influence on the predictability of ontological annotation.

The available methods to assess the impact of these variants rely primarily upon evolutionary conservation with little to no consideration of the structural and functional implications for the protein.

Results: To address this, we investigate protein features underlying loss-of-function genetic variation and develop a machine learning method, MutPred-LOF, for the discrimination of pathogenic and tolerated variants that can also generate hypotheses on specific molecular events disrupted by the variant. We investigate a large set of human variants derived from the Human Gene Mutation Database, ClinVar and the Exome Aggregation Consortium. Our prediction method shows an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 0.85 for all loss-of-function variants and 0.75 for proteins in which both pathogenic and neutral variants have been observed. We applied MutPred-LOF to a set of 1142 de novo vari3ants from neurodevelopmental disorders and find enrichment of pathogenic variants in affected individuals.

We extend the results to a noisy setting where some of the examples labeled positive are in fact negative and show that the correction also requires the knowledge of the proportion of noisy examples in the labeled positives.

To this end, many studies have investigated the structural and functional impact of amino acid substitutions. Most of these studies were however limited in scope to either individual molecular functions or were concerned with functional effects (e.g. deleterious vs. neutral) without specifically considering possible molecular alterations. The recent growth of structural, molecular and genetic data presents an opportunity for more comprehensive studies to consider the structural environment of a residue of interest, to hypothesize specific molecular effects of sequence variants and to statistically associate these effects with genetic disease. In this study, we analyzed data sets of disease-causing and putatively neutral human variants mapped to protein 3D structures as part of a systematic study of the loss and gain of various types of functional attribute potentially underlying pathogenic molecular alterations. We first propose a formal model to assess probabilistically function-impacting variants. We then develop an array of structure-based functional residue predictors, evaluate their performance, and use them to quantify the impact of disease-causing amino acid substitutions on catalytic activity, metal binding, macromolecular binding, ligand binding, allosteric regulation and post-translational modifications. We show that our methodology generates actionable biological hypotheses for up to 41% of disease-causing genetic variants mapped to protein structures suggesting that it can be reliably used to guide experimental validation. Our results suggest that a significant fraction of disease-causing human variants mapping to protein structures are function-altering both in the presence and absence of stability disruption."

Specifically, we embark on the challenge of identifying the tractable answer orderings that allow for ranked direct access with such complexity guarantees. We begin with lexicographic orderings and give a decidable characterization (under conventional complexity assumptions) of the class of tractable lexicographic orderings for every CQ without self-joins. We then continue to the more general orderings by the sum of attribute weights and show for it that ranked direct access is tractable only in trivial cases. Hence, to better understand the computational challenge at hand, we consider the more modest task of providing access to only a single answer (i.e., finding the answer at a given position) - a task that we refer to as the selection problem. We indeed achieve a quasilinear-time algorithm for a subset of the class of full CQs without self-joins, by adopting a solution of Frederickson and Johnson to the classic problem of selection over sorted matrices. We further prove that none of the other queries in this class admit such an algorithm."

Yet SQL can be hard to read, even for expert users or the original creator of a query. We conjecture that it is possible to capture the logical intent of queries in automatically-generated visual diagrams that can help users understand the meaning of queries faster and more accurately than SQL text alone. We present initial steps in that direction with visual diagrams that are based on the first-order logic foundation of SQL and can capture the meaning of deeply nested queries. Our diagrams build upon a rich history of diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic and were designed using a large body of human-computer interaction best practices: they are minimal in that no visual element is superfluous; they are unambiguous in that no two queries with different semantics map to the same visualization; and they extend previously existing visual representations of relational schemata and conjunctive queries in a natural way. An experimental evaluation involving 42 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that with only a 2--3 minute static tutorial, participants could interpret queries meaningfully faster with our diagrams than when reading SQL alone. Moreover, we have evidence that our visual diagrams result in participants making fewer errors than with SQL. We believe that more regular exposure to diagrammatic representations of SQL can give rise to a pattern-based and thus more intuitive use and re-use of SQL.

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption."

CoRR, abs/2404.14141. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14141","Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed problem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities and evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a tension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the contest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The competitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to their self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their peers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless on 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000 individuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative explanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this tension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly competitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest competitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when high-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not directly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level use of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level outcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term participation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to participate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This suggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future participation. These findings have important implications for the literature on crowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing communities."

We further explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest -- social (non-profit) or monetary (for-profit) -- moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness. We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives, such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators' preferences (and the ability to satisfy diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives. We provide managers with guidance to design effective incentives by improving incentive-preference fit for ideators."

Our results show that the human resemblance of a voice assistant's voice negatively interacts with the helpfulness of an agent's contribution to flip its effect on perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy. This means human teammates interpret the agent's contributions differently depending on its voice. Our study found no significant effect of voice on perceived intelligence, trustworthiness, or team performance.

First, signaling interactions in dynamic networks are sufficient to cause the endogenous formation of distinct signaling groups, even in an initially homogeneous population. Second, dynamic networks allow the emergence of novel {\em hybrid} signaling groups that do not converge on a single common signaling system but are instead composed of different yet complementary signaling strategies. We show that the presence of these hybrid groups promotes stable diversity in signaling among other groups in the population. Third, we find important distinctions in information processing capacity of different groups: hybrid groups diffuse information more quickly initially but at the cost of taking longer to reach all group members.

Here we describe our design of a simple system, called Minglr, which supports this kind of interaction by facilitating the matching of conversational partners. We describe two studies of this system’s use at two virtual conferences with over 450 total participants. Our results provide evidence for the usefulness of this capability, showing that, for example, 81% of people who used the system successfully thought that future virtual conferences should include a tool with similar functionality. We believe that similar functionality is likely to be widely implemented in many videoconferencing systems and to increase the feasibility and desirability of many kinds of remote work and socializing."

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size."

To tame these undefined behaviors, we introduce a framework ouroboros, which builds verified NNs that follow user-defined specifications. These specifications comprise input and output constraints which characterize the behaviors of a NN. We do a case study on database learned indexes to demonstrate that training verified NN models is possible.

It is the first system that combines (a) black-box checking, of (b) serializability, while (c) scaling to real-world online transactional processing workloads. The core technical challenge is that the underlying search problem is computationally expensive. COBRA tames that problem by starting with a suitable SMT solver. COBRA then introduces several new techniques, including a new encoding of the validity condition; hardware acceleration to prune inputs to the solver; and a transaction segmentation mechanism that enables scaling and garbage collection. Cobra imposes modest overhead on clients, improves over baselines by 10× in verification cost, and (unlike the baselines) supports continuous verification. Our artifact can handle 2000 transactions/sec, equivalent to 170M/day."

Optimal adjustment sets for causal query estimation in partially observed biomolecular networks Bioinform., 39, 494-503. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad270","Causal query estimation in biomolecular networks commonly selects a ‘valid adjustment set’, i.e. a subset of network variables that eliminates the bias of the estimator. A same query may have multiple valid adjustment sets, each with a different variance. When networks are partially observed, current methods use graph-based criteria to find an adjustment set that minimizes asymptotic variance. Unfortunately, many models that share the same graph topology, and therefore same functional dependencies, may differ in the processes that generate the observational data. In these cases, the topology-based criteria fail to distinguish the variances of the adjustment sets. This deficiency can lead to sub-optimal adjustment sets, and to miss-characterization of the effect of the intervention. We propose an approach for deriving ‘optimal adjustment sets’ that takes into account the nature of the data, bias and finite-sample variance of the estimator, and cost. It empirically learns the data generating processes from historical experimental data, and characterizes the properties of the estimators by simulation. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in four biomolecular Case studies with different topologies and different data generation processes.

A noise-robust deep clustering of biomolecular ions improves interpretability of mass spectrometric images Bioinform., 39. https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad067","Motivation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) analyzes complex biological samples such as tissues. It simultaneously characterizes the ions present in the tissue in the form of mass spectra, and the spatial distribution of the ions across the tissue in the form of ion images. Unsupervised clustering of ion images facilitates the interpretation in the spectral domain, by identifying groups of ions with similar spatial distributions. Unfortunately, many current methods for clustering ion images ignore the spatial features of the images, and are therefore unable to learn these features for clustering purposes. Alternative methods extract spatial features using deep neural networks pre-trained on natural image tasks; however, this is often inadequate since ion images are substantially noisier than natural images. Results We contribute a deep clustering approach for ion images that accounts for both spatial contextual features and noise. In evaluations on a simulated dataset and on four experimental datasets of different tissue types, the proposed method grouped ions from the same source into a same cluster more frequently than existing methods. We further demonstrated that using ion image clustering as a pre-processing step facilitated the interpretation of a subsequent spatial segmentation as compared to using either all the ions or one ion at a time. As a result, the proposed approach facilitated the interpretability of MSI data in both the spectral domain and the spatial domain.

However, the methods used to collect, analyze, and visualize data collected with Likert scales are inconsistent among evaluations in visualization papers. In this paper, we examine the use of Likert scales as a tool for measuring subjective response in a systematic review of 134 visualization evaluations published between 2009 and 2019. We find that papers with both objective and subjective measures do not hold the same reporting and analysis standards for both aspects of their evaluation, producing less rigorous work for the subjective qualities measured by Likert scales. Additionally, we demonstrate that many papers are inconsistent in their interpretations of Likert data as discrete or continuous and may even sacrifice statistical power by applying nonparametric tests unnecessarily. Finally, we identify instances where key details about Likert item construction with the potential to bias participant responses are omitted from evaluation methodology reporting, inhibiting the feasibility and reliability of future replication studies. We summarize recommendations from other fields for best practices with Likert data in visualization evaluations, based on the results of our survey.

INP consists of two components, a spatiotemporal surrogate model built upon Neural Process (NP) family and an acquisition function for active learning. For surrogate modeling, we develop Spatiotemporal Neural Process (STNP) to mimic the simulator dynamics. For active learning, we propose a novel acquisition function, Latent Information Gain (LIG), calculated in the latent space of NP based models. We perform a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LIG reduces sample complexity compared with random sampling in high dimensions. We also conduct empirical studies on three complex spatiotemporal simulators for reaction diffusion, heat flow, and infectious disease. The results demonstrate that STNP outperforms the baselines in the offline learning setting and LIG achieves the state-of-the-art for Bayesian active learning."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

One might notice that one group's average is larger than another's, or that a difference in values is smaller than a difference between two others, or any of a combinatorial explosion of other possibilities. The message that a viewer tends to notice--the message that a visualization 'affords'--is strongly affected by how values are arranged in a chart, e.g., how the values are colored or positioned. Although understanding the mapping between a chart's arrangement and what viewers tend to notice is critical for creating guidelines and recommendation systems, current empirical work is insufficient to lay out clear rules. We present a set of empirical evaluations of how different messages--including ranking, grouping, and part-to-whole relationships--are afforded by variations in ordering, partitioning, spacing, and coloring of values, within the ubiquitous case study of bar graphs.

To explore a dataset, the user selects combinations of features in the dataset that they are interested in.

SliceLens guides the user in determining which feature combinations to explore. Guidance is based on a user-selected rating metric, which assigns a score to the subsets created by a given combination of features. The purpose of the metrics are to detect interesting patterns in the subsets, such as subsets that have high label purity or an uneven distribution of errors. SliceLens uses the metrics to guide the user towards combinations of features that create potentially interesting subsets in two ways. First, SliceLens assigns a rating to each feature based on the subsets that would be created by selecting that feature. This incremental guidance can help the user determine which feature to select next. Second, SliceLens can suggest combinations of features ranked according to the chosen metric, which the user can then cycle through."

These photosensitivity warnings are an important accessibility feature for people with photosensitive epilepsy, allowing them to avoid interacting with content that may trigger seizures. However, little is known about how these warnings should be structured to maximize effectiveness in helping with people PSE navigate visual media safely. The design space for photosensitivity warnings is vast and includes questions such as what details to include about strobing light sequences or the content itself, where to place warnings within an interface, and what methods to use to extract information about the strobing light sequences (e.g., crowdsourced or automated methods). In this work, we contribute a thematic analysis of crowdsourced warnings drawn from the DoesTheDogDie online forum and an interview study with five people who have been diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy about design considerations for photosensitivity warnings on digital platforms. To guide our interviews, we assembled examples of both crowdsourced and automated warnings about seizure-inducing content in films. Automated warnings were presented in the form of a high fidelity sketch demonstrating what an automated system for photosensitivity warnings might look like when deployed by a film streaming platform.

Our findings allow researchers and practitioners to better understand the meaning of photosensitive accessibility in the context of VR, and provide a step towards enabling people with PSE to enjoy the benefits offered by immersive technology."

To better understand the design space for photosensitive risk warnings, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 265 crowdsourced warnings about flashing lights in films.

These errors can be caught by critical readings of visualizations, but readers must have a high level of data and design literacy and must be paying close attention. To address this issue, we introduce VisuaLint: a technique for surfacing chart construction errors in situ. Inspired by the ubiquitous red wavy underline that indicates spelling mistakes, visualization elements that contain errors (e.g., axes and legends) are sketchily rendered and accompanied by a concise annotation. VisuaLint is unobtrusive — it does not interfere with reading a visualization — and its direct display establishes a close mapping between erroneous elements and the expression of error. We demonstrate five examples of VisualLint and present the results of a crowdsourced evaluation (N = 62) of its efficacy. These results contribute an empirical baseline proficiency for recognizing chart construction errors, and indicate near-universal difficulty in error identification. We find that people more reliably identify chart construction errors after being shown examples of VisuaLint, and prefer more verbose explanations for unfamiliar or less obvious flaws."

Hypergraphs are a fairly common data structure but there is little consensus on how to visualize them. To optimize a hypergraph drawing for readability, we need a layout algorithm. Common graph layout algorithms only consider ordinary graphs and do not take hyperedges into account. We focus on layered hypergraphs, a particular class of hypergraphs that, like layered graphs, assigns every vertex to a layer, and the vertices in a layer are drawn aligned on a linear axis with the axes arranged in parallel. In this paper, we propose a general method to apply layered graph layout algorithms to layered hypergraphs. We introduce six different transformations for layered hypergraphs. The choice of transformation affects the subsequent graph layout algorithm in terms of computational performance and readability of the results. Thus, we perform a comparative evaluation of these transformations in terms of number of crossings, edge length, and impact on performance. We also provide two case studies showing how our transformations can be applied to real-life use cases.

Yet SQL can be hard to read, even for expert users or the original creator of a query. We conjecture that it is possible to capture the logical intent of queries in automatically-generated visual diagrams that can help users understand the meaning of queries faster and more accurately than SQL text alone. We present initial steps in that direction with visual diagrams that are based on the first-order logic foundation of SQL and can capture the meaning of deeply nested queries. Our diagrams build upon a rich history of diagrammatic reasoning systems in logic and were designed using a large body of human-computer interaction best practices: they are minimal in that no visual element is superfluous; they are unambiguous in that no two queries with different semantics map to the same visualization; and they extend previously existing visual representations of relational schemata and conjunctive queries in a natural way. An experimental evaluation involving 42 users on Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that with only a 2--3 minute static tutorial, participants could interpret queries meaningfully faster with our diagrams than when reading SQL alone. Moreover, we have evidence that our visual diagrams result in participants making fewer errors than with SQL. We believe that more regular exposure to diagrammatic representations of SQL can give rise to a pattern-based and thus more intuitive use and re-use of SQL.

This paper explores digital proxemics, which describe how we use space in virtual environments and how the presence of others influences our behaviours, interactions, and movements. First, we frame the open challenges of digital proxemics in terms of activity, social signals, audio design, and environment. We explore a subset of these challenges through an evaluation that compares two audio designs and two displays with different social signal affordances: head-mounted display (HMD) versus desktop PC. We use quantitative methods using instrumented tracking to analyse behaviour, demonstrating how personal space, proximity, and attention compare between desktop PC and HMDs."

However, there is a large breach for people with visual impairments to access diverse graphics, let alone drawing. There are several techniques of tactile graphics, such as swell paper, Braille embossing, and thermoform that help to alleviate this gap. However, in developing countries, the high cost and lack of access make them impractical. In this work, we describe our experience improving access to tactile graphics and drawing in Colombia. We created low-cost, effective and efficient, tactile graphics and drawing techniques that improve on current solutions. These techniques were created from the best practices of two projects adapting pieces from the Colombian art heritage [52, 53] for blind and visually impaired people. They were then applied to a third project: running a virtual tactile drawing club with blind and visually impaired participants in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned from these experiences are presented in this paper with the hope they can help the community democratize access to tactile graphics."

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two datasets, Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (TACoS), and wet lab, using conventional evaluation measures such as the Jaccard Index and Hamming Loss, as well as a human-subjects study."

In this article, we first showcase a user study on how anchoring bias can potentially affect mental model formations when users initially interact with an intelligent system and the role of explanations in addressing this bias. Using a video activity recognition tool in cooking domain, we asked participants to verify whether a set of kitchen policies are being followed, with each policy focusing on a weakness or a strength. We controlled the order of the policies and the presence of explanations to test our hypotheses. Our main finding shows that those who observed system strengths early on were more prone to automation bias and made significantly more errors due to positive first impressions of the system, while they built a more accurate mental model of the system competencies. However, those who encountered weaknesses earlier made significantly fewer errors, since they tended to rely more on themselves, while they also underestimated model competencies due to having a more negative first impression of the model. Motivated by these findings and similar existing work, we formalize and present a conceptual model of user’s past experiences that examine the relations between user’s backgrounds, experiences, and human factors in XAI systems based on usage time. Our work presents strong findings and implications, aiming to raise the awareness of AI designers toward biases associated with user impressions and backgrounds."

""Untidy data: The unreasonable effectiveness of tables."" IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, (2021).","Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and ""get their hands on"" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools."

Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making."

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system.

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

This led to a comparison among four conditions: controller input using 2D keys, controller input using 3D keys, hand-tracking input using 2D keys, hand-tracking input using 3D keys. Results from our user study (n = 28) revealed that controller input (15.3 WPM) outperformed hand-tracking input (13.8 WPM) in terms of text entry rates and that protruded 3D keys (15.6 WPM) led to faster text entry performance than did flat 2D keys (13.4 WPM). While the four conditions did not differ in error rates, flat 2D keys led to a greater number of character corrections. In addition, results showed that compared to flat 2D keys, protruded 3D keys lowered the perceived mental workload of the text entry task. These results indicate that despite the technological advances in hand-tracking technology, controller input is still more performant than hand-tracking input for VR text entry tasks and that protruded 3D keys afford faster text entry and better user experience than do flat 2D keys. That said, hand-tracking input can still be used for mid-air text entry without extreme performance losses."

However, little is known about how these warnings should be structured to maximize effectiveness in helping with people PSE navigate visual media safely. The design space for photosensitivity warnings is vast and includes questions such as what details to include about strobing light sequences or the content itself, where to place warnings within an interface, and what methods to use to extract information about the strobing light sequences (e.g., crowdsourced or automated methods). In this work, we contribute a thematic analysis of crowdsourced warnings drawn from the DoesTheDogDie online forum and an interview study with five people who have been diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy about design considerations for photosensitivity warnings on digital platforms. To guide our interviews, we assembled examples of both crowdsourced and automated warnings about seizure-inducing content in films. Automated warnings were presented in the form of a high fidelity sketch demonstrating what an automated system for photosensitivity warnings might look like when deployed by a film streaming platform.

Checkpointing is an important component in any strategy for software resilience and for long-running jobs that must be executed by chaining together time-bounded resource allocations. This work solves an old problem: a practical and general algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI that is both efficient and compatible with most of the latest network software. Transparent checkpointing is attractive due to its generality and ease of use for most MPI application developers. Earlier efforts at transparent checkpointing for MPI, one decade ago, had two difficult problems: (i) by relying on a specific MPI implementation tied to a specific network technology; and (ii) by failing to demonstrate sufficiently low runtime overhead.Problem (i) (network dependence) was already solved in 2019 by MANA's introduction of split processes. Problem (ii) (efficient runtime overhead) is solved in this work. This paper introduces an approach that avoids these limitations, employing a novel topological sort to algorithmically determine a safe future synchronization point. The algorithm is valid for both blocking and non-blocking collective communication in MPI. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach through both micro-benchmarks and a set of five real-world MPI applications, notably including the widely used VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package), which is responsible for 11% of the workload on the Perlmutter supercomputer at Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory. VASP was previously cited as a special challenge for checkpointing, in part due to its multi-algorithm codes."

The problem is made more difficult when supporting collective operations across processes, such as barrier, reduce operations, scatter and gather, etc. Some processes may have reached the barrier or other collective operation, while other processes wait a long time to reach that same barrier or collective operation. At least two solutions are well-known in the literature: (I) draining in-flight network messages and then freezing the network at checkpoint time; and (ii) adding a barrier prior to the collective operation, and either completing the operation or aborting the barrier if not all processes are present. Both solutions suffer important drawbacks. The code in the first solution must be updated whenever one ports to a newer network. The second solution implies additional barrier-related network traffic prior to each collective operation. This work presents a third solution that avoids both drawbacks. There is no additional barrier-related traffic, and the solution is implemented entirely above the network layer. The work is demonstrated in the context of transparent checkpointing of MPI libraries for parallel computation, where each of the first two solutions have already been used in prior systems, and then abandoned due to the aforementioned drawbacks. Experiments demonstrate the low runtime overhead of this new, network-agnostic approach. The approach is also extended to non-blocking, collective operations in order to handle overlapping of computation and communication."

CRAC combines: low runtime overhead (approximately 1% or less); fast checkpoint-restart; support for scalable CUDA streams (for efficient usage of all of the thousands of GPU cores); and support for the full features of Unified Virtual Memory (eliminating the programmer's burden of migrating memory between device and host). CRAC achieves its flexible architecture by segregating application code (checkpointed) and its external GPU communication via non-reentrant CUDA libraries (not checkpointed) within a single process's memory.

While the totality of SG data represents a tremendous contribution to genomics and structural biology, reliable functional information for these proteins is generally lacking. Better functional predictions for SG proteins will add substantial value to the structural information already obtained. Our method described herein, Graph Representation of Active Sites for Prediction of Function (GRASP-Func), predicts quickly and accurately the biochemical function of proteins by representing residues at the predicted local active site as graphs rather than in Cartesian coordinates. We compare the GRASP-Func method to our previously reported method, Structurally Aligned Local Sites of Activity (SALSA), using the Ribulose Phosphate Binding Barrel (RPBB), 6-Hairpin Glycosidase (6-HG), and Concanavalin A-like Lectins/Glucanase (CAL/G) superfamilies as test cases. In each of the superfamilies, SALSA and the much faster method GRASP-Func yield similar correct classification of previously characterized proteins, providing a validated benchmark for the new method. In addition, we analyzed SG proteins using our SALSA and GRASP-Func methods to predict function. Forty-one SG proteins in the RPBB superfamily, nine SG proteins in the 6-HG superfamily, and one SG protein in the CAL/G superfamily were successfully classified into one of the functional families in their respective superfamily by both methods. This improved, faster, validated computational method can yield more reliable predictions of function that can be used for a wide variety of applications by the community.

To program these architectures using ordinary languages such as C, a dataflow compiler must transform the original sequential, imperative program into an equivalent dataflow graph, composed of dataflow operators running in parallel. This transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in the original imperative programs. We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture. Our tool uncovers 8 compiler bugs where the compiler outputs incorrect dataflow graphs, including a data race that is otherwise hard to discover via testing. After repairing these bugs, our tool verifies the correct compilation of all programs in the RipTide benchmark suite."

Our goal is to simplify proofs for cryptographic protocols by introducing a core calculus, IPDL, for cryptographic observational equivalences. Via IPDL, we aim to address a number of theoretical issues for cryptographic proofs in a simple manner, including probabilistic behaviors, distributed message-passing, and resource-bounded adversaries and simulators. We demonstrate IPDL on a number of case studies, including a distributed coin toss protocol, Oblivious Transfer, and the GMW multi-party computation protocol.

Viaduct's source language allows developers to declaratively specify security policies by annotating their programs with information flow labels.

We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos.

In this paper, we outline how we can encode design constraints into a compact circuit representation that affords generation without search. These generators yield samples that are distributed uniformly over the space of valid designs. We illustrate our approach with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) in comparison to the traditional approach with answer-set programming (ASP) in two scenarios: a grid-based tile placement scenario inspired by WaveFunctionCollapse, and a playable platformer level design scenario. These compiled design-space models make constraint-based methods easier to deploy by improving on both the running time and diversity of previous constraint-based methods."

Existing quantum circuit simulators do not address the common traits of variational algorithms, namely: 1) their ability to work with noisy qubits and operations, 2) their repeated execution of the same circuits but with different parameters, and 3) the fact that they sample from circuit final wavefunctions to drive a classical optimization routine. We present a quantum circuit simulation toolchain based on logical abstractions targeted for simulating variational algorithms. Our proposed toolchain encodes quantum amplitudes and noise probabilities in a probabilistic graphical model, and it compiles the circuits to logical formulas that support efficient repeated simulation of and sampling from quantum circuits for different parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art state vector and density matrix quantum circuit simulators, our simulation approach offers greater performance when sampling from noisy circuits with at least eight to 20 qubits and with around 12 operations on each qubit, making the approach ideal for simulating near-term variational quantum algorithms.

The computational challenge of probabilistic inference remains the primary roadblock for applying PPLs in practice. Inference is fundamentally hard, so there is no one-size-fits all solution. In this work, we target scalable inference for an important class of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete . Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis, network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis, but they prove to be challenging for existing PPLs. We develop a domain-specific probabilistic programming language called Dice that features a new approach to exact discrete probabilistic program inference. Dice exploits program structure in order to factorize inference, enabling us to perform exact inference on probabilistic programs with hundreds of thousands of random variables. Our key technical contribution is a new reduction from discrete probabilistic programs to weighted model counting (WMC). This reduction separates the structure of the distribution from its parameters, enabling logical reasoning tools to exploit that structure for probabilistic inference. We (1) show how to compositionally reduce Dice inference to WMC, (2) prove this compilation correct with respect to a denotational semantics, (3) empirically demonstrate the performance benefits over prior approaches, and (4) analyze the types of structure that allow Dice to scale to large probabilistic programs."

In this work we provide the first example of an exact lifted inference algorithm for arbitrary discrete factor graphs. In addition we describe a lifted Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm that provably mixes rapidly in the degree of symmetry of the distribution."

It is currently difficult to compactly represent the subtle independence properties of a probabilistic program, and exploit independence properties to decompose inference. Classical graphical model abstractions do capture some properties of the underlying distribution, enabling inference algorithms to operate at the level of the graph topology. However, we observe that graph-based abstractions are often too coarse to capture interesting properties of programs. We propose a form of sound abstraction for probabilistic programs wherein the abstractions are themselves simplified programs. We provide a theoretical foundation for these abstractions, as well as an algorithm to generate them. Experimentally, we also illustrate the practical benefits of our framework as a tool to decompose probabilistic program inference."

We present the Automatic Automata Checker (A2C), an open source library that enables one to construct executable automata using definitions that mimic those found in standard textbooks. Such constructions are easy to reason about using semantic equivalence checks, properties and test cases. Instructors can conveniently specify solutions in the form of their own constructions. A2C can check for semantic equivalence between student and instructor solutions and can immediately generate actionable feedback, which helps students better understand the material. A2C can be downloaded and used locally by students as well as integrated into Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Gradescope to automatically grade student submissions and generate feedback. A2C is based on the ACL2s interactive theorem prover, which provides advanced methods for stating, proving and disproving properties. Since feedback is automatic, A2C can be deployed at scale and integrated into massively open online courses."

The score function depends on several parameters (weights, caps, thresholds) that can be configured by applications using GossipSub. The specification for GossipSub is written in English and its resilience to attacks from misbehaving peers is supported empirically by emulation testing using an implementation in Golang.In this work we take a foundational approach to understanding the resilience of GossipSub to attacks from misbehaving peers. We build the first formal model of GossipSub, using the ACL2s theorem prover. Our model is officially endorsed by the GossipSub developers. It can simulate GossipSub networks of arbitrary size and topology, with arbitrarily configured peers, and can be used to prove and disprove theorems about the protocol. We formalize fundamental security properties stating that the score function is fair, penalizes bad behavior, and rewards good behavior. We prove that the score function is always fair, but can be configured in ways that either penalize good behavior or ignore bad behavior. Using our model, we run GossipSub with the specific configurations for two popular real-world applications: the FileCoin and Eth2.0 blockchains. We show that all properties hold for FileCoin. However, given any Eth2.0 network (of any topology and size) with any number of potentially misbehaving peers, we can synthesize attacks where these peers are able to continuously misbehave by never forwarding topic messages, while maintaining positive scores so that they are never pruned from the network by GossipSub."

However, they are challenging to implement correctly because they have to deal with any unexpected message from byzantine peers and ensure safety and liveness at all times. Many formal frameworks have been developed to verify the safety of SMR implementations, but there is still a gap in the verification of their liveness. Existing liveness proofs are either limited to the network level or do not cover popular partially synchronous protocols. We introduce LiDO, a consensus model that enables the verification of both safety and liveness of implementations through refinement. We observe that current consensus models cannot handle liveness because they do not include a pacemaker state. We show that by adding a pacemaker state to the LiDO model, we can express the liveness properties of SMR protocols as a few safety properties that can be easily verified by refinement proofs. Based on our LiDO model, we provide mechanized safety and liveness proofs for both unpipelined and pipelined Jolteon in Coq. This is the first mechanized liveness proof for a byzantine consensus protocol with non-trivial optimizations such as pipelining."

We claim this is due to the lack of an appropriate abstraction that is capable of representing both benign and byzantine consensus without either losing too much detail or becoming impractically complex. We build on recent work on the atomic distributed object model to fill this void with a novel abstraction called AdoB. In addition to revealing important insights into the essence of consensus, this abstraction has practical benefits for easing distributed system verification. As a case study, we proved safety and liveness properties for AdoB in Coq, which are the first such mechanized proofs to handle benign and byzantine consensus in a unified manner. We also demonstrate that AdoB faithfully models real consensus protocols by proving it is refined by standard network-level specifications of Fast Paxos and a variant of Jolteon."

Despite a recent abundance of impressive verification work in this area, we claim the ways that past efforts model distributed state are not ideal for protocol-level reasoning: they either hide important details, or leak too much complexity from the network. As evidence we observe that nearly all of them avoid the complex, but important issue of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration's primary challenge lies in how it interacts with a protocol's core safety invariants. To handle this increased complexity, we introduce the Adore model, whose novel abstract state hides network-level communications while capturing dependencies between committed and uncommitted states, as well as metadata like election quorums. It includes first-class support for a generic reconfiguration command that can be instantiated with a variety of implementations. Under this model, the subtle interactions between reconfiguration and the core protocol become clear, and with this insight we completed the first mechanized proof of safety of a reconfigurable consensus protocol."

Network and node failures are inevitable and, for some applications, careful control over how they are handled is essential. Unfortunately, existing approaches either completely hide these failures behind an atomic state machine replication (SMR) interface, or expose all of the network-level details, sacrificing atomicity. We propose a novel, compositional, atomic distributed object (ADO) model for strongly consistent distributed systems that combines the best of both options. The object-oriented API abstracts over protocol-specific details and decouples high-level correctness reasoning from implementation choices. At the same time, it intentionally exposes an abstract view of certain key distributed failure cases, thus allowing for more fine-grained control over them than SMR-like models. We demonstrate that proving properties even of composite distributed systems can be straightforward with our Coq verification framework, Advert, thanks to the ADO model. We also show that a variety of common protocols including multi-Paxos and Chain Replication refine the ADO semantics, which allows one to freely choose among them for an application's implementation without modifying ADO-level correctness proofs."

By hiding the logic for distributed coordination underneath a data-centric API, the WOR abstraction enables easy, incremental, and extensible implementation and verification of applications built above it. We present the design, implementation, and verification of a system called WormSpace that provides developers with an address space of WORs, implementing each WOR via a Paxos instance.

For example, a server may spread terabytes of data across many different storage media, ranging from magnetic disks, DRAM, NAND-based solid state drives (SSDs), as well as hybrid drives that package various combinations of these technologies. It follows that access latencies to data can vary hugely depending on which media the data resides on. At the same time, modern storage systems naturally retain older versions of data due to the prevalence of log-structured designs and caches in software and hardware layers. In a sense, a contemporary storage system is very similar to a small-scale distributed system, opening the door to consistency/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose a class of local storage systems called StaleStores that support relaxed consistency, returning stale data for better performance. We describe several examples of StaleStores, and show via emulations that serving stale data can improve access latency by between 35% and 20X. We describe a particular StaleStore called Yogurt, a weakly consistent local block storage system. Depending on the application's consistency requirements (e.g. bounded staleness, mono-tonic reads, read-my-writes, etc.), Yogurt queries the access costs for different versions of data within tolerable staleness bounds and returns the fastest version. We show that a distributed key-value store running on top of Yogurt obtains a 6X speed-up for access latency by trading off consistency and performance within individual storage servers."

As a result, new high-level storage abstractions—and new designs for existing abstractions—are difficult to realize, requiring developers to implement from scratch complex functionality such as failure atomicity and fine-grained concurrency control. In this paper, we argue that pushing transactional isolation into the block store (in addition to atomicity and durability) is both viable and broadly useful, resulting in simpler high-level storage systems that provide strong semantics without sacrificing performance. We present Isotope, a new block store that supports ACID transactions over block reads and writes. Internally, Isotope uses a new multi-version concurrency control protocol that exploits fine-grained, sub-block parallelism in workloads and offers both strict serializability and snapshot isolation guarantees. We implemented several high-level storage systems over Isotope, including two key-value stores that implement the LevelDB API over a hashtable and B-tree, respectively, and a POSIX filesystem. We show that Isotope’s block-level transactions enable systems that are simple (100s of lines of code), robust (i.e., providing ACID guarantees), and fast (e.g., 415 MB/s for random file writes). We also show that these systems can be composed using Isotope, providing applications with transactions across different high-level constructs such as files, directories and key-value pairs.

However, these environmental assumptions may occasionally be violated due to modeling errors or faults. Ideally, the system guarantees its critical properties even under some of these violations, i.e., the system is \emph{robust} against environmental deviations. This paper proposes a notion of \emph{robustness} as an explicit, first-class property of a transition system that captures how robust it is against possible \emph{deviations} in the environment. We modeled deviations as a set of \emph{transitions} that may be added to the original environment. Our robustness notion then describes the safety envelope of this system, i.e., it captures all sets of extra environment transitions for which the system still guarantees a desired property. We show that being able to explicitly reason about robustness enables new types of system analysis and design tasks beyond the common verification problem stated above. We demonstrate the application of our framework on case studies involving a radiation therapy interface, an electronic voting machine, a fare collection protocol, and a medical pump device."

It is relatively easy to implement and requires very little training data, making it a popular approach. Generated game levels are guaranteed to look locally similar totheir example tilemaps; however, local adjacency rules often fail to capture global solvability rules, potentially making many such levels unplayable. Existing approaches to improving the solvability of WFC-generated levels typically require adding additional game-specific information in the form of global constraints, substantially increasing the complexity and time required for setup. The purpose of this work is to explore whether using level solutions as training data can allow WFC to learn solvability constraints and game mechanics. We have implemented a novel space-time approach that uses three-dimensional space-time blocks representing solutions to 2D levels as both input and output. Experiments using this method show that space-time WFC is capable of demonstrating localized game mechanics and creating small playable levels with given solutions. However, levels are slow to generate, and some high-level constraints are still not captured."

We used an algorithmic solver to estimate the difficulty of the puzzles by capturing the number of ``solver loops'' through the algorithm. This characteristic was used to generate and evaluate a set of puzzles of varying algorithmic difficulty using constrained MAP-Elites. Then, we ran a user study to gather information on the player experience of these puzzles. We tested the relationship between solver loops and player experience on generated puzzles and found that the number of solver loops is statistically significantly correlated with subjective perception of difficulty and borderline statistically significantly correlated with puzzle correctness."

We ran a crowdsourced study in which two factors were varied: whether participants could asynchronously collaborate via access to solutions previously provided by other participants, and whether participants had access to quality-diversity search tools.

We include transform nodes, which apply transformations to other nodes in the behavior tree, allowing more complex mechanics to be expressed in a compact way. We demonstrate a text-based approach to using TRRBTs to create several simple games, show how the approach allows re-use of trees to build on existing games, and show how they can provide a unified representation for procedural content generation and enemy AI along with game mechanics."

AGD approaches generally rely on approximations of human play, either objective functions or AI agents. Despite this, the majority of these approximators are static, meaning they do not reflect human player's ability to learn and improve in a game. In this paper, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an approximator for human play for rule generation. We recreate the classic AGD environment Mechanic Maker in Unity as a new, open-source rule generation framework. Our results demonstrate that RL produces distinct sets of rules from an A* agent baseline, which may be more usable by humans."

As a potential solution, some game developers look to narrative as an experience-enhancing feature. Yet the impacts and affordances of narrative in citizen science games remain understudied, especially for games that require significant onboarding. Therefore, we investigated the effects of wrapping a story around the tutorial puzzles of the citizen science game Foldit. We found that the narrative increased the time players spent engaging with the game’s tutorial and its scientific puzzles but did not substantially affect their progress through the tutorial. This article provides two major contributions: (1) empirical evidence detailing the impact of narrative on gameplay metrics in a citizen science game, including the relevant effects of genre preferences on engagement; and (2) recommendations on the use of narrative and its capacities in citizen science games. We conclude that the inclusion of a narrative can add valuable depth to the experience when designed thoughtfully and intentionally."

We present results of a qualitative content analysis of the quantitative data used in 337 blog posts published by five pairs of conservative and liberal advocacy organizations over the course of the month leading up to the 2016 US elections. We identify key data rhetoric practices along partisan lines and contribute an analytic framework-evaluating ethos, pathos, and logos- that can be used to analyze the rhetorical use of data in other contexts. We then characterize two different imaginaries that come into conflict in this research: 1) the political imaginaries being promoted through organizational blogging and 2) the sociotechnical imaginary of the data economy, foregrounding differences in the epistemic value of data in each. We conclude by outlining research challenges and trajectories for future research within each of the two imaginaries of data."

Their choices play into broader political tensions; social media platforms are situated within a social context that frames their impact, and they can have politics through their design that enforce power structures and serve existing authorities. We turn to Pillowfort, a small social media platform, to examine these political tensions as a case study. Using a discourse analysis, we examine public discussion posts between staff and users as they negotiate the site's development over a period of two years. Our findings illustrate the tensions in navigating the politics that users bring with them from previous platforms, the difficulty of building a site's unique identity and encouraging commitment, and examples of how design decisions can both foster and break trust with users.

However, these discussions have largely centered around member-researcher status and positionality when working with queer populations. Based on insights gathered at multiple ACM events over the past two years, we identified two pressing issues: (1) we need to better support queer people doing HCI research not specific to queer populations, and (2) we need to identify how to best support member-researchers in leading Queer HCI while including collaborators beyond the queer community. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to directly address these challenges by convening a broad community of queer researchers and allies, working not only on explicitly-queer topics but across a broad range of HCI topics."

To understand the dynamics of multi-user, co-located, AR storytelling, we conducted an exploratory study involving three original AR narratives. Participants experienced each narrative alone or in pairs via the Microsoft Hololens 2. We collected qualitative and quantitative data from 42 participants through questionnaires and post-experience semi-structured interviews. Results indicate participants enjoyed experiencing AR narratives together and revealed five themes relevant to the design of multi-user, co-located AR narratives. We discuss the implications of these themes and provide design recommendations for AR experience designers and storytellers regarding the impact of interaction, physical space, spatial coherence, and narrative timing. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring both user interactions and pair interactions as factors in AR storytelling research."

In this work, we present Tile Rewrite Rule Behavior Trees (TRRBTs): a concept for a domain-specific language for authoring tile-based, turn-based games. The approach combines tile rewrite rules and behavior trees. Using TRRBTs, a game’s state is represented as a grid of tiles, the behavior trees describe the overall flow of the game, and the rewrite rules at leaf nodes describe changes in game state. We include transform nodes, which apply transformations to other nodes in the behavior tree, allowing more complex mechanics to be expressed in a compact way. We demonstrate a text-based approach to using TRRBTs to create several simple games, show how the approach allows re-use of trees to build on existing games, and show how they can provide a unified representation for procedural content generation and enemy AI along with game mechanics."

We propose a Bayesian formalization of content generators as probability distributions and show how common PCG tasks map naturally to operations on the distribution.

The long-term goal of this work is to understand how CSCW researchers and designers could best support members of marginalized groups to make sense of and to seek support for experiences with racism. Narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. For example, participants' personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. In addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. We discuss how participants' accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who ""gets it"" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups."

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

Effective clinical decision-making, including the detection of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and the monitoring of associated symptoms, remains a challenging task for clinicians. This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making."

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust.

Our findings characterize tensions between tradition and ‘modernization,’ implications for technology design, and the need for a temporal approach to understanding communities. We conclude with broader implications for studying the intersection of race and religion in community technology design."

We present a participatory design methodology for culturally tailoring virtual agents. Investigators worked with key informants from our target population, members of predominantly Black church communities, to design culturally-relevant and sensitive virtual agent health promotion interventions. In the first participatory session, key informants designed agents to assist them with different aspects of their lives, providing input on agent appearance and agent functionality. In a second design session, participants re-wrote the content of a health conversation with an agent, to include personally-relevant content related to their community (e.g., religious and scriptural references). We report design principles for religious tailoring derived from these studies. We conducted a validation study to assess the effects of applying these principles to agents that promoted two health behaviors, finding that participants responded very positively to the tailored agents."

Algorithmic pluralism describes a state of affairs in which no set of algorithms severely limits access to opportunity, allowing individuals the freedom to pursue a diverse range of life paths. To argue for algorithmic pluralism, we adopt Joseph Fishkin’s theory of bottlenecks, which focuses on the structure of decision-points that determine how opportunities are allocated. The theory contends that each decision-point or “bottleneck’’ limits access to opportunities with some degree of severity and legitimacy. We extend Fishkin’s structural viewpoint and use it to reframe existing systemic concerns about equal opportunity in algorithmic decision-making, such as patterned inequality and algorithmic monoculture. In proposing algorithmic pluralism, we argue for the urgent priority of alleviating severe bottlenecks in algorithmic-decision-making. We contend that there must be a pluralism of opportunity available to many different individuals in order to promote equal opportunity in a systemic way. We further show how this framework has several implications for system design and regulation through current debates about equal opportunity in algorithmic hiring."

In practice, the societal impact of machine learning is determined by the surrounding context of machine learning deployments. To capture this, we introduce ecosystem-level analysis: rather than analyzing a single model, we consider the collection of models that are deployed in a given context. For example, ecosystem-level analysis in hiring recognizes that a job candidate's outcomes are not only determined by a single hiring algorithm or firm but instead by the collective decisions of all the firms they applied to. Across three modalities (text, images, speech) and 11 datasets, we establish a clear trend: deployed machine learning is prone to systemic failure, meaning some users are exclusively misclassified by all models available. Even when individual models improve at the population level over time, we find these improvements rarely reduce the prevalence of systemic failure. Instead, the benefits of these improvements predominantly accrue to individuals who are already correctly classified by other models. In light of these trends, we consider medical imaging for dermatology where the costs of systemic failure are especially high. While traditional analyses reveal racial performance disparities for both models and humans, ecosystem-level analysis reveals new forms of racial disparity in model predictions that do not present in human predictions. These examples demonstrate ecosystem-level analysis has unique strengths for characterizing the societal impact of machine learning."

While sharing offers clear advantages (e.g. amortizing costs), does it bear risks? We introduce and formalize one such risk, outcome homogenization: the extent to which particular individuals or groups experience negative outcomes from all decision-makers. If the same individuals or groups exclusively experience undesirable outcomes, this may institutionalize systemic exclusion and reinscribe social hierarchy. To relate algorithmic monoculture and outcome homogenization, we propose the component-sharing hypothesis: if decision-makers share components like training data or specific models, then they will produce more homogeneous outcomes. We test this hypothesis on algorithmic fairness benchmarks, demonstrating that sharing training data reliably exacerbates homogenization, with individual-level effects generally exceeding group-level effects. Further, given the dominant paradigm in AI of foundation models, i.e. models that can be adapted for myriad downstream tasks, we test whether model sharing homogenizes outcomes across tasks. We observe mixed results: we find that for both vision and language settings, the specific methods for adapting a foundation model significantly influence the degree of outcome homogenization.

We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature."

One algorithmic decision-making system can replace thousands of human deciders. Each of the humans so replaced had her own decision-making criteria: some good, some bad, and some arbitrary. Is such arbitrariness of moral concern? We argue that an isolated arbitrary decision need not morally wrong the individual whom it misclassifies. However, if the same algorithms are applied across a public sphere, such as hiring or lending, a person could be excluded from a large number of opportunities.

And yet, we repeatedly find platforms and algorithms that push communities further into the margins. In this paper, we propose epistemic autonomy -- one's ability to govern knowledge about themselves -- as a necessary HCI paradigm for working with marginalized communities. We establish epistemic autonomy by applying the transfeminine principle of autonomy to the problem of epistemic injustice. To articulate the harm of violating one's epistemic autonomy, we present six stories from two trans women: (1) a transfem online administrator and (2) a transfem researcher. We then synthesize our definition of epistemic autonomy in research into a research paradigm. Finally, we present two variants of common HCI methods, autoethnography and asynchronous remote communities, that stem from these beliefs. We discuss how CHI is uniquely situated to champion this paradigm and, thereby, the epistemic autonomy of our research participants."

Even on platforms that do exist for sapphics, transgender women and nonbinary people are often subject to discrimination, fetishization, and stigmatization. To aid in the design of platforms that better serve the needs of multiply marginalized sapphics, we engaged a diverse group of 25 sapphics in six rounds of community discussion on key topics for relationship platform design. Based on participant discussions, we identify key challenges when designing for multiply marginalized sapphics around relationship structures, gender and sexuality classification, and safety priorities for interaction.

We found that marginalized social media users develop folk theories informed by their perceptions of platforms’ spirit to explain instances where their content was moderated in ways that violate their perceptions of how content moderation should work in practice.

While policies around knowledge are essential for targeting misinformation, they are value-laden; in choosing how to present information, we undermine non-traditional, often non-Western, ways of knowing. Epistemic injustice is the systemic exclusion of certain people and methods from the knowledge canon. Epistemic injustice chips away at one's testimony and vocabulary until they are stripped of their due right to know and understand. In this paper, we articulate how epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications leads to material harm. Inspired by a hybrid collaborative autoethnography of 14 CSCW practitioners, we present three cases of epistemic injustice in sociotechnical applications: online transgender healthcare, identity sensemaking on r/bisexual, and Indigenous ways of knowing on r/AskHistorians. We further explore signature tensions across our autoethnographic materials and relate them to previous CSCW research areas and personal non-technological experiences. We argue that epistemic injustice can serve as a unifying and intersectional lens for CSCW research by surfacing dimensions of epistemic community and power. Finally, we present a call to action of three changes the CSCW community should make to move toward its own goals of research justice. We call for CSCW researchers to center individual experiences, bolster communities, and remediate issues of epistemic power as a means towards epistemic justice. In sum, we recount, synthesize, and propose solutions for the various forms of epistemic injustice that CSCW sites of study---including CSCW itself---propagate."

We present results of a qualitative content analysis of the quantitative data used in 337 blog posts published by five pairs of conservative and liberal advocacy organizations over the course of the month leading up to the 2016 US elections. We identify key data rhetoric practices along partisan lines and contribute an analytic framework-evaluating ethos, pathos, and logos- that can be used to analyze the rhetorical use of data in other contexts. We then characterize two different imaginaries that come into conflict in this research: 1) the political imaginaries being promoted through organizational blogging and 2) the sociotechnical imaginary of the data economy, foregrounding differences in the epistemic value of data in each. We conclude by outlining research challenges and trajectories for future research within each of the two imaginaries of data."

We turn to Pillowfort, a small social media platform, to examine these political tensions as a case study. Using a discourse analysis, we examine public discussion posts between staff and users as they negotiate the site's development over a period of two years. Our findings illustrate the tensions in navigating the politics that users bring with them from previous platforms, the difficulty of building a site's unique identity and encouraging commitment, and examples of how design decisions can both foster and break trust with users.

In order to address this threat, it is important to understand exactly what fake news is. After surveying the various definitions that have been proposed in the philosophical literature, we argue that fake news is best understood as counterfeit news . A story is genuine news if and only if it has gone through the standard modern journalistic process involving professionally trained reporters, fact checkers, and editors. And a story is counterfeit news if and only if it is not genuine news, but is presented as genuine news, with the intention and propensity to deceive. This analysis is a contribution to ‘systems-oriented social epistemology’ (Goldman, Alvin I. 2011. “A Guide to Social Epistemology.” In Social Epistemology: Essential Readings , edited by Alvin I. Goldman, and Dennis Whitcomb, 11–37. New York: Oxford University Press). Various social institutions, such as science and journalism, provide important epistemic benefits to society. But unscrupulous agents are often motivated to leverage the epistemic authority of these institutions by counterfeiting them. People can thereby be misled and/or lose faith in these institutions. Thus, society may suffer significant epistemic costs when such counterfeits proliferate. ABSTRACT KEYWORDS: Fake news deception conceptual analysis social epistemology counterfeits"

While conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are adept at tracking diverse objects, toddlers pose unique challenges due to their unpredictable movements, various poses, and similar appearance. Tracking toddlers in indoor environments introduces additional complexities such as occlusions and limited fields of view. In this paper, we address the challenges of MTT and propose MTTSort, a customized method built upon the DeepSort algorithm. MTTSort is designed to track multiple toddlers in indoor videos accurately. Our contributions include discussing the primary challenges in MTT, introducing a genetic algorithm to optimize hyperparameters, proposing an accurate tracking algorithm, and curating the MTTrack dataset using unbiased AI co-labeling techniques. We quantitatively compare MTTSort to state-of-the-art MOT methods on MTTrack, DanceTrack, and MOT15 datasets. In our evaluation, the proposed method outperformed other MOT methods, achieving 0.98, 0.68, and 0.98 in multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA), and iterative and discriminative framework 1 (IDF1) metrics, respectively."

One barrier to clinical (or algorithmic) assessment of NNS stems from its sparsity, requiring experts to wade through hours of footage to find minutes of relevant activity. Our NNS activity segmentation algorithm solves this problem by identifying periods of NNS with high certainty -- up to 94.0\% average precision and 84.9\% average recall across 30 heterogeneous 60 s clips, drawn from our manually annotated NNS clinical in-crib dataset of 183 hours of overnight baby monitor footage from 19 infants. Our method is based on an underlying NNS action recognition algorithm, which uses spatiotemporal deep learning networks and infant-specific pose estimation, achieving 94.9\% accuracy in binary classification of 960 2.5 s balanced NNS vs. non-NNS clips.

To address this issue, we recently demonstrated that biosensor data combined with linear classification algorithms (i.e., ridge-regularized logistic regression) can be used to predict aggression up to 1 minute before it occurs using 3 minutes of data from the past with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71-0.84 depending on whether population versus individual models are used. In the present study, we both extend and enhance these prior results through the use of principal component analysis and a nonlinear kernel-based classifier (Support Vector Machines). Our results illustrate that these newly applied methods yield significant improvements, predicting aggression up to 3 minutes before it occurs with an average AUC of 0.98 in both population and individual models. Furthermore, we extend our prior work by evaluating aggression prediction performance across varying observed aggression intensities and find that moderate and high intensity aggression episodes are detectable with 2 to 5% higher average AUC than low-intensity aggression episodes."

Facial expressions are a sensitive, specific biomarker of the presence and severity of pain, and computer vision (CV) and machine-learning (ML) techniques enable reliable, valid measurement of pain-related facial expressions from video. We developed and evaluated a CVML approach to measure pain-related facial expressions for automated pain assessment in youth. Methods: A CVML-based model for assessment of pediatric postoperative pain was developed from videos of 50 neurotypical youth 5 to 18 years old in both endogenous/ongoing and exogenous/transient pain conditions after laparoscopic appendectomy. Model accuracy was assessed for self-reported pain ratings in children and time since surgery, and compared with by-proxy parent and nurse estimates of observed pain in youth. Results: Model detection of pain versus no-pain demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84-0.94) in both ongoing and transient pain conditions. Model detection of pain severity demonstrated moderate-to-strong correlations (r = 0.65-0.86 within; r = 0.47-0.61 across subjects) for both pain conditions. The model performed equivalently to nurses but not as well as parents in detecting pain versus no-pain conditions, but performed equivalently to parents in estimating pain severity. Nurses were more likely than the model to underestimate youth self-reported pain ratings. Demographic factors did not affect model performance. Conclusions: CVML pain assessment models derived from automatic facial expression measurements demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy in binary pain classifications, strong correlations with patient self-reported pain ratings, and parent-equivalent estimation of children's pain levels over typical pain trajectories in youth after appendectomy."

Program optimization allows programmers to focus on developing novel algorithms that produce desired fabrics while deferring concerns of efficient machine operations to the optimizer. We present KODA, the Knit-program Optimization by Dependency Analysis method.

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

EMAs allow for temporally dense, ecologically valid data collection, but frequent interruptions with lengthy surveys on mobile devices can burden users, impacting compliance and data quality. We propose a method that reduces the length of each EMA question set measuring interrelated constructs, with only modest information loss. By estimating the potential information gain of each EMA question using question-answer prediction models, this method can prioritize the presentation of the most informative question in a question-by-question sequence and skip uninformative questions. We evaluated the proposed method by simulating question omission using four real-world datasets from three different EMA studies. When compared against the random question omission approach that skips 50% of the questions, our method reduces imputation errors by 15%-52%. In surveys with five answer options for each question, our method can reduce the mean survey length by 34%-56% with a real-time prediction accuracy of 72%-95% for the skipped questions. The proposed method may either allow more constructs to be surveyed without adding user burden or reduce response burden for more sustainable longitudinal EMA data collection."

We introduce an alternative and novel form of micro-interaction self-report using speech input - audio-μEMA- where a short beep or vibration cues participants to verbally report their behavioral states, allowing for open-ended, temporally dense self-reports. We conducted a one-hour usability study followed by a within-subject, 6-day to 21-day free-living feasibility study in which participants self-reported their physical activities and postures once every 2 to 5 minutes.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

Mobile technologies have been developed to motivate individuals with SCI to increase PA using activity tracking and real-time feedback. We conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 15 manual wheelchair users with SCI and eight of their family members/friends to investigate user impressions of future technologies that might use computer-mediated, sensor-triggered communication to motivate PA. We assessed barriers to PA and how context-aware communication could help overcome them. Participants with SCI expressed that PA tracking and communication technologies must be tailored to their specific needs. Further analysis revealed that context-aware messaging could help participants with SCI connect with others to initiate timely conversations about overcoming PA barriers, and to provide encouragement to meet their PA goals. We discuss opportunities to empower individuals with SCI with regards to PA using tailored, context-aware communication."

Microinteraction EMA (μEMA), is a type of EMA where each survey is only one single question that can be answered with a glanceable microinteraction on a smartwatch. Prior work shows that even when μEMA interrupts far more frequently than smartphone-EMA, μEMA yields higher response rates with lower burden. We examined the contextual biases associated with non-response of μEMA prompts on a smartwatch. Based on prior work on EMA non-response and smartwatch use, we identified 10 potential contextual biases from three categories: temporal (time of the day, parts of waking day, day of the week, and days in study), device use (screen state, charging status, battery mode, and phone usage), and activity (wrist motion and location). We used data from a longitudinal study where 131 participants (Mean age 22.9 years, SD = 3.0) responded to μEMA surveys on a smartwatch for at least six months. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, we found that all temporal, activity/mobility, and device use variables had a statistically significant (p<0.001) association with momentary μEMA non-response. We discuss the implication of these results for future use of context-aware μEMA methodology."

EMA has a key limitation: interruption burden. Microinteraction-EMA(µEMA) may reduce burden without sacrificing high temporal density of measurement. In µEMA, all EMA prompts can be answered with ‘at a glance' microinteractions. In a prior 4-week pilot study comparing standard EMA delivered on a phone (phone-EMA) vs. µEMA delivered on a smartwatch (watch-µEMA), watch-µEMA demonstrated higher response rates and lower perceived burden than phone-EMA, even when the watch-µEMA interruption rate was 8 times more than phone-EMA. A new 4-week dataset was gathered on smartwatch-based EMA (i.e., watch-EMA with 6 back-to-back, multiple-choice questions on a watch) to compare whether the high response rates of watch-µEMA previously observed were a result of using microinteractions, or due to the novelty and accessibility of the smartwatch. No statistically significant differences in compliance, completion, and first-prompt response rates were observed between phone-EMA and watch-EMA. However, watch-µEMA response rates were significantly higher than watch-EMA. This pilot suggests that (1) the high compliance and low burden previously observed in watch-µEMA is likely due to the microinteraction question technique, not simply the use of the watch versus the phone, and that (2) compliance with traditional EMA (with long surveys) may not improve simply by moving survey delivery from the phone to a smartwatch."

Our analysis revealed 841 live animals represented in ACI research, encompassing 23 different types of animals across 10 research contexts. We observed differences in the demographic information correlating with the animals’ types and contexts. We argue that these differences might reflect biases about animals and could impact the interdisciplinary exchange of research findings. In particular, descriptors such as breed, species, and context-specific details were frequently reported, while aspects like personalities, life experiences, and social relationships were less consistently documented, and only in some specific contexts. We discuss the implications of these findings for research validity, reproducibility, and ethical considerations within ACI, proposing recommendations for more consistent and comprehensive reporting practices.

Over a six-month study, parrots triggered significantly more live calls and engaged longer in that setting relative to the playback condition, while the animals’ caregivers found greater value in the latter but preferred the live alternative for the birds under their care.

Here, we examine seven months of a single parrot’s sustained use of a tablet-based AAC totaling 129 sessions within 190 days. After devising a coding schema, we propose a framework to explore the expressive potential and enrichment value for the parrot.

Much of our current understanding is derived from multi-user VR applications, which can differ significantly in presence, social interaction, and spatial awareness from narratives and other entertainment content designed for AR head-worn displays. To understand the dynamics of multi-user, co-located, AR storytelling, we conducted an exploratory study involving three original AR narratives. Participants experienced each narrative alone or in pairs via the Microsoft Hololens 2. We collected qualitative and quantitative data from 42 participants through questionnaires and post-experience semi-structured interviews. Results indicate participants enjoyed experiencing AR narratives together and revealed five themes relevant to the design of multi-user, co-located AR narratives. We discuss the implications of these themes and provide design recommendations for AR experience designers and storytellers regarding the impact of interaction, physical space, spatial coherence, and narrative timing. Our findings highlight the importance of exploring both user interactions and pair interactions as factors in AR storytelling research."

We detail the work citizen science project managers did to shape volunteer experiences: aligning science goals, minimizing barriers to participation, engaging communities, communicating with volunteers, providing training and education, rewarding contributions, and reflecting on volunteer work. These management strategies created opportunities for meaningful work by cultivating intrinsic motivation and fostering collaborative work relationships but ultimately limited participation to specific data-related tasks.

However, researchers have yet to delve into the ways moderators support one another in combating hate and harassment within the communities they moderate through participation in meta-communities of moderators. To address this gap, we have conducted a qualitative content analysis of 115 hate and harassment-related threads from r/ModSupport and r/modhelp, two major subreddit forums for moderators for this type of mutual support. Our study reveals that moderators seek assistance on topics ranging from fighting attacks to understanding Reddit policies and rules to just venting their frustration. Other moderators respond to these requests by validating their frustration and challenges, showing emotional support, and providing information and tangible resources to help with their situation.

We scraped Twitter to gather 5252 Carrds from fans in a variety of fandoms, which we analyzed using a combination of keyword searches and hand-coding. Fans’ Carrds frequently disclose queer identity, and articulate a complex system of community values and boundary management.

This work investigates the role technical terms play in policy transparency. We identify potentially misunderstood technical terms that appear in privacy policies through a survey of current privacy policies and a pilot user study. We then run a user study on Amazon Mechanical Turk to evaluate whether users can accurately define these technical terms, to identify commonly held misconceptions, and to investigate how the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with privacy policies. We find that technical terms are broadly misunderstood and that particular misconceptions are common. We also find that the use of technical terms affects users’ comfort with various privacy policies and their reported likeliness to accept those policies. We conclude that current use of technical terms in privacy policies poses a challenge to policy transparency and user privacy, and that companies should take steps to mitigate this effect.

Participants frequently returned to themes of activism and prosocial behavior, such as protest organization, political speech, and role-modeling transgender identities, so we focus our analysis on these themes. We identify several prominent risk models related to visibility, luck, and identity that participants used to analyze their own risk profiles, often as distinct or extreme. These risk perceptions may heavily influence transgender people's defensive behaviors and self-efficacy, jeopardizing their ability to defend themselves or gain technology's benefits.

Therefore, a critical social skill for these agents is Theory of Mind (ToM): the ability to model and reason about other agents. Research has investigated ToM in LLMs using standard, modified, and extended versions of false-belief tasks. These tests include explicit prompts asking LLMs to answer questions about other agents. However, in real situations, people have to use ToM unprompted to navigate social life. Additionally, oftentimes, people have to rely on nonverbal cues such as facial expressions. This work seeks to address this gap by studying implicit ToM in LLMs in a negotiation task. In negotiation, agents have to implicitly reason about other agents to reach an agreed-upon best possible deal. We conducted the negotiation experiment by prompting different LLMs to roleplay as characters and pitting them against rule-based agents that may respond with different facial expressions. We measure and compare the outcomes of the negotiation across models. Our results show that strong LLMs like GPT-4 turbo and Claude 3 Opus can perform decently and adjust their offers based on access to facial expression information, but weaker models are far behind. Our work contributes to our understanding of LLMs’ capabilities and limitations for serving as intelligent and interactive agents."

Constraint-based generators ensure that certain properties hold in each design they output.

In this paper, we outline how we can encode design constraints into a compact circuit representation that affords generation without search. These generators yield samples that are distributed uniformly over the space of valid designs. We illustrate our approach with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) in comparison to the traditional approach with answer-set programming (ASP) in two scenarios: a grid-based tile placement scenario inspired by WaveFunctionCollapse, and a playable platformer level design scenario. These compiled design-space models make constraint-based methods easier to deploy by improving on both the running time and diversity of previous constraint-based methods."

We propose a Bayesian formalization of content generators as probability distributions and show how common PCG tasks map naturally to operations on the distribution. Further, through a series of experiments with maze generation, we demonstrate how probabilistic logic semantics allows us to leverage the authorial control of declarative programming and the flexibility of learning from data."

In supply chains, multiple decision-makers act on uncertain information they receive from others, often leading to sub-optimal decisions that propagate the effects of supply chain disruptions to other stakeholders. Therefore, understanding how humans learn to interpret information from others and how it influences their decision-making is key to alleviating supply chain shortages. In this work, we investigated how downstream supply chain echelons, health centers in pharmaceutical supply chains, interpret and use manufacturers' estimated resupply date (ERD) information during drug shortages. We formulated a computational model of a health center based on a partially observable Markov decision process that learns a manufacturer's information sharing tendencies through an observation function. To investigate the model and important factors influencing decisions and perceptions of ERD, we conducted a human experiment to study where subjects played the role of a health center during a drug shortage. They received ERDs from a manufacturer on a weekly basis and decided whether or not to switch to an alternative product (and pay additional costs) to avoid running out of stock. The results show that different manufacturers' sequences of ERDs and the accuracy of ERDs could impact subjects' decisions, beliefs, performance, and perception of the manufacturer. We also found that the subjective belief of ERDs is the best predictor of subjects' switching decisions. Lastly, we fit the observation function's learning rate and show that the model can predict subjects' decisions better than other baseline models in most conditions."

Modeling and being able to predict people's behavior in such situations, how they cope, is a critical research topic. To that end, we propose a computational model of coping that casts Lazarus' theory of coping into a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. This includes an appraisal process that models the factors that lead to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models people's behavior in the face of such stress. This coping process includes problem-focused coping, whereby people seek to alter the external environment, and emotion-focused coping, whereby people alter their internal beliefs, goals, and intentions in the face of stress. We evaluate the model's assumptions and predictions in the context of a high-stress situation that is increasingly common, the extreme conditions of a hurricane. We collected human survey data from the last several years of major U.S. hurricanes to evaluate the features in the models used for appraisal calculation. Additionally, we conducted a controlled human-subject experiment simulating a hurricane experience to investigate the prediction of the model on how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation. The results show that, as predicted by the model, the proposed model features are significantly associated with the evacuation decisions and post-decision people also change their beliefs and goals in the directions that align with their prior decisions. Lastly, we conduct a simulation study showing that the proposed model is qualitatively closer to the experiment data than the baseline models that do not incorporate coping effects."

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

We conducted a one-hour usability study followed by a within-subject, 6-day to 21-day free-living feasibility study in which participants self-reported their physical activities and postures once every 2 to 5 minutes. We qualitatively explored the usability of the system and identified factors impacting the response rates of this data collection method. Despite being interrupted 12 to 20 times per hour, participants in the free-living study were highly engaged with the system, with an average response rate of 67.7% for audio-μEMA for up to 14 days. We discuss the factors that impacted feasibility; some implementation, methodological, and participant challenges we observed; and important considerations relevant to deploying audio-μEMA in real-time activity recognition systems."

This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making."

To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. Toward this, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is slow, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of this workshop for the last five years, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in developing a holistic approach for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health."

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3448116","Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that ""negated"" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such ""negative"" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers."

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3432220","Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-the-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress. There is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions."

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two datasets, Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (TACoS), and wet lab, using conventional evaluation measures such as the Jaccard Index and Hamming Loss, as well as a human-subjects study."

In this article, we first showcase a user study on how anchoring bias can potentially affect mental model formations when users initially interact with an intelligent system and the role of explanations in addressing this bias. Using a video activity recognition tool in cooking domain, we asked participants to verify whether a set of kitchen policies are being followed, with each policy focusing on a weakness or a strength. We controlled the order of the policies and the presence of explanations to test our hypotheses. Our main finding shows that those who observed system strengths early on were more prone to automation bias and made significantly more errors due to positive first impressions of the system, while they built a more accurate mental model of the system competencies. However, those who encountered weaknesses earlier made significantly fewer errors, since they tended to rely more on themselves, while they also underestimated model competencies due to having a more negative first impression of the model. Motivated by these findings and similar existing work, we formalize and present a conceptual model of user’s past experiences that examine the relations between user’s backgrounds, experiences, and human factors in XAI systems based on usage time.

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

For differently-sized training sets, we assess speaker adaptation by transfer learning, including layer freezing and sentence selection using maximum likelihood of forced alignment. The methodological framework utilizes statistical parametric speech synthesis based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We compare objective scores for 576 voice models, representing all condition combinations. For a constrained set of conditions we also present results from a subjective listening test. We show that speaker adaptation improves overall quality in nearly all cases, sentence selection helps detecting recording errors and layer freezing proves to be ineffective in our system.

Despite the negative impacts of workplace surveillance, gig workers lack the tools, strategies, and workplace social support to protect themselves against these harms. Meanwhile, some critical theorists have proposed sousveillance as a potential means of countering such abuses of power, whereby those under surveillance monitor those in positions of authority (e.g., gig workers collect data about requesters/platforms). To understand the benefits of sousveillance systems in the gig economy, we conducted semi-structured interviews and led co-design activities with gig workers. We use “care ethics” as a guiding concept to understand our interview and co-design data, while also focusing on empathic sousveillance technology design recommendations. Through our study we identify gig workers’ attitudes towards and past experiences with sousveillance. We also uncover the type of sousveillance technologies imagined by workers, provide design recommendations, and finish by discussing how to create empowering, empathic spaces on gig platforms."

In this paper, we present a system to identify and address political data voids within underrepresented communities. Armed with an interview study, indicating that the independent news media has the potential to address them, we designed an intelligent collaborative system, called Datavoidant. Datavoidant uses state-of-the-art machine learning models and introduces a novel design space to provide independent journalists with a collective understanding of data voids to facilitate generating content to cover the voids. We performed a user interface evaluation with independent news media journalists (N=22). These journalists reported that Datavoidant's features allowed them to more rapidly while easily having a sense of what was taking place in the information ecosystem to address the data voids. They also reported feeling more confident about the content they created and the unique perspectives they had proposed to cover the voids.

Medical regulations and the prevailing culture have greatly impacted how ecosystems are structured and stakeholders work together, including whether clinicians and makers collaborate. To better understand these care ecosystems, we interviewed a range of stakeholders from multiple countries, including Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, France, India, Mexico, and the U.S. Our broad analysis allowed us to uncover different working examples of how multiple stakeholders collaborate within these care ecosystems and the main challenges they face.

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3476060","Crowdsourcing markets provide workers with a centralized place to find paid work. What may not be obvious at first glance is that, in addition to the work they do for pay, crowd workers also have to shoulder a variety of unpaid invisible labor in these markets, which ultimately reduces workers' hourly wages. Invisible labor includes finding good tasks, messaging requesters, or managing payments. However, we currently know little about how much time crowd workers actually spend on invisible labor or how much it costs them economically. To ensure a fair and equitable future for crowd work, we need to be certain that workers are being paid fairly for all of the work they do. In this paper, we conduct a field study to quantify the invisible labor in crowd work. We build a plugin to record the amount of time that 100 workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk dedicate to invisible labor while completing 40,903 tasks. If we ignore the time workers spent on invisible labor, workers' median hourly wage was3.76.But,weestimatedthatcrowdworkersinourstudyspent332.83. We found that the invisible labor differentially impacts workers depending on their skill level and workers' demographics. The invisible labor category that took the most time and that was also the most common revolved around workers having to manage their payments. The second most time-consuming invisible labor category involved hyper-vigilance, where workers vigilantly watched over requesters' profiles for newly posted work or vigilantly searched for labor. We hope that through our paper, the invisible labor in crowdsourcing becomes more visible, and our results help to reveal the larger implications of the continuing invisibility of labor in crowdsourcing."

Existing marketplaces may thus not embody workers’ or requesters’ needs. In this paper, we imagine a future where anyone could create the crowd markets they desire. We study the characteristics of the markets that 40 workers and 40 requesters from Amazon Mechanical Turk propose. We uncover that workers pushed for marketplaces that either empowered workers to set their own salaries without requiring a minimum wage or had intelligent algorithms that could automatically decide the salaries while also ensuring everyone received a minimum wage. Requesters were consistent in their preference of paying by commission and preferred markets that automatically set the salary. Both workers and requesters advocated for mechanisms to ensure quality and flexible time schedules in the market. We conclude by discussing design implications from our findings."

One reason for this is that it is difficult for workers to accurately gauge the hourly wages of microtasks, and they consequently end up performing labor with little pay. In general, workers are provided with little information about tasks, and are left to rely on noisy signals, such as textual description of the task or rating of the requester. This study explores various computational methods for predicting the working times (and thus hourly wages) required for tasks based on data collected from other workers completing crowd work. We provide the following contributions. (i) A data collection method for gathering real-world training data on crowd-work tasks and the times required for workers to complete them; (ii) TurkScanner: a machine learning approach that predicts the necessary working time to complete a task (and can thus implicitly provide the expected hourly wage). We collected 9,155 data records using a web browser extension installed by 84 Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, and explored the challenge of accurately recording working times both automatically and by asking workers. TurkScanner was created using ~ 150 derived features, and was able to predict the hourly wages of 69.6% of all the tested microtasks within a 75% error. Directions for future research include observing the effects of tools on people's working practices, adapting this approach to a requester tool for better price setting, and predicting other elements of work (e.g., the acceptance likelihood and worker task preferences.)"

In this work, we gathered stories of meaningful experiences by conducting a qualitative semi-structured interview with 17 BIPOC students from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds, all studying across various PWIs. Our preliminary findings revealed that students derive meaningful experiences by engaging in activities that lead to the cultivation of learned values and personal growth. We discuss and situate our findings within a positive design framework to support BIPOC students’ sustained well-being and flourishing."

Recently, games have emerged as promising avenues for exploring queerness. In this research-through-design (RtD) effort, we advance queer explorations in games by leveraging queer temporality to evoke and explore feelings of alienation and isolation in a horror game called You're Going To Be Late. We further engage with queer individuals who playtest our game and participate in focus groups to discuss how queer they felt our game was and what they regard as queer game mechanics. Participants had varying experiences while playing our game, ranging from serendipity and wonder to alienation and confusion. The focus groups described queer game mechanics as queer modes of play and often tapped into gender representation. Finally, we show how including and amplifying queer voices in discursive efforts around interactive technology design has implications for transformative and critical reflections that can broadly benefit game design and HCI research."

The long-term goal of this work is to understand how CSCW researchers and designers could best support members of marginalized groups to make sense of and to seek support for experiences with racism. Narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. For example, participants' personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. In addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. We discuss how participants' accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who ""gets it"" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups."

Building on the theory's original tenets, we argue that racism is pervasive in everyday socio-technical systems; that the HCI community is prone to ""interest convergence"", where concessions to inclusion require benefits to those in power; and that the neoliberal underpinnings of the technology industry itself propagate racism. Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deep-seated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI. The implications: all HCI research must be attuned to issues of race; participation of underrepresented minorities must be sought in all of our activities; and as a community, we cannot become comfortable while racial disparities exist."

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

""Untidy data: The unreasonable effectiveness of tables."" IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, (2021).","Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and ""get their hands on"" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools."

DOI: 10.1145/3548606.3560594","This paper proposes using a logic programming language to disentangle X.509 certificate validation policy from mechanism. Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Hammurabi into Firefox and the Go language in less than 100 lines of code each."

Online services covered by the CCPA are required to provide a hyperlink on their homepage with the text “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” (DNSMPI). The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020, a date that was chosen to give data collectors time to study the new law and bring themselves into compliance. In this study, we begin the process of investigating whether websites are complying with the CCPA by focusing on DNSMPI links. Using longitudinal data crawled from the top 1M websites in the Tranco ranking, we examine which websites are including DNSMPI links, whether the websites without DNSMPI links are out of compliance with the law, whether websites are using geofences to dynamically hide DNSMPI links from nonCalifornians, how DNSMPI adoption has changed over time, and how websites are choosing to present DNSMPI links (e.g., in terms of font size, color, and placement). We argue that the answers to these questions are critical for spurring enforcement actions under the law, and helping to shape future privacy laws and regulations, e.g., rule making that will soon commence around the successor to the CCPA, known as the CPRA."

Achieving this goal, however, is complex: the developer must (1) deeply engage with social and legal facets of ""fairness"" in a given context, (2) develop software that concretizes these values, and (3) undergo an independent algorithm audit to ensure technical correctness and social accountability of their algorithms. To date, there are few examples of companies that have transparently undertaken all three steps. In this paper we outline a framework for algorithmic auditing by way of a case-study of pymetrics, a startup that uses machine learning to recommend job candidates to their clients. We discuss how pymetrics approaches the question of fairness given the constraints of ethical, regulatory, and client demands, and how pymetrics' software implements adverse impact testing. We also present the results of an independent audit of pymetrics' candidate screening tool. We conclude with recommendations on how to structure audits to be practical, independent, and constructive, so that companies have better incentive to participate in third party audits, and that watchdog groups can be better prepared to investigate companies."

Existing studies on this topic have hitherto adopted a coarse concept of misinformation, which incorporates a broad spectrum of story types ranging from political conspiracies to misinterpreted pranks. This paper aims to structurize these misinformation stories by leveraging fact-check articles. Our intuition is that key phrases in a fact-check article that identify the misinformation type(s) (e.g., doctored images, urban legends) also act as rationales that determine the verdict of the fact-check (e.g., false). We experiment on rationalized models with domain knowledge as weak supervision to extract these phrases as rationales, and then cluster semantically similar rationales to summarize prevalent misinformation types. Using archived fact-checks from Snopes.com, we identify ten types of misinformation stories. We discuss how these types have evolved over the last ten years and compare their prevalence between the 2016/2020 US presidential elections and the H1N1/COVID-19 pandemics."

These consequences are framed under the public's susceptibility to such misinformation — a narrative that needs further investigation and quantification. To this end, our paper proposes an observational approach to model and measure expressed (dis)beliefs in (mis)information by leveraging social media comments as a proxy. We collect a sample of tweets in response to (mis)information and annotate them with (dis)belief labels, explore the dataset using lexicon-based methods, and finally build classifiers based on the state-of-the-art neural transfer-learning models (BERT, XLNet, and RoBERTa). Under a domain-specific thresholding strategy for unbiasedness, the best-performing classifier archives macro-F 1 scores around 0.86 for disbelief and 0.80 for belief. Applying the classifier, we conduct a large-scale measurement study and show that, for true/mixed/false claims on social media, 12%/14%/15% of comments express disbelief and 26%/21%/20% of comments express belief. In addition, our results suggest an extremely slight time effect of falsehood awareness, a positive effect of fact-checks to false claims, and differences in (dis)belief across social media platforms."

However, programmatic advertising has also given rise to a novel form of ad fraud known as domain spoofing, in which attackers sell counterfeit impressions that claim to be from high-value publishers. To mitigate domain spoofing, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab introduced the ads.txt standard in May 2017 to help ad buyers verify authorized digital ad sellers, as well as to promote overall transparency in programmatic advertising. In this work, we present a 15-month longitudinal, observational study of the ads.txt standard. We do this to understand (1) if it is helping ad buyers to combat domain spoofing and (2) whether the transparency offered by the standard can provide useful data to researchers and privacy advocates. With respect to halting domain spoofing, we observe that over 60% of Alexa Top-100K publishers that run RTB ads have adopted ads.txt, and that ad exchanges and advertisers appear to be honoring the standard. With respect to transparency, the widespread adoption of ads.txt allows us to explicitly identify over 1,000 domains belonging to ad exchanges, without having to rely on crowdsourcing or heuristic methods. However, we also find that ads.txt is still a long way from reaching its full potential. Many publishers have yet to adopt the standard, and we observe major ad exchanges purchasing unauthorized impressions that violate the standard. This opens the door to domain spoofing attacks. Further, ads.txt data often include errors that must be cleaned and mitigated before the data is practically useful."

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities.

However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time.

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

This led to a comparison among four conditions: controller input using 2D keys, controller input using 3D keys, hand-tracking input using 2D keys, hand-tracking input using 3D keys. Results from our user study (n = 28) revealed that controller input (15.3 WPM) outperformed hand-tracking input (13.8 WPM) in terms of text entry rates and that protruded 3D keys (15.6 WPM) led to faster text entry performance than did flat 2D keys (13.4 WPM). While the four conditions did not differ in error rates, flat 2D keys led to a greater number of character corrections. In addition, results showed that compared to flat 2D keys, protruded 3D keys lowered the perceived mental workload of the text entry task. These results indicate that despite the technological advances in hand-tracking technology, controller input is still more performant than hand-tracking input for VR text entry tasks and that protruded 3D keys afford faster text entry and better user experience than do flat 2D keys.

These photosensitivity warnings are an important accessibility feature for people with photosensitive epilepsy, allowing them to avoid interacting with content that may trigger seizures. However, little is known about how these warnings should be structured to maximize effectiveness in helping with people PSE navigate visual media safely. The design space for photosensitivity warnings is vast and includes questions such as what details to include about strobing light sequences or the content itself, where to place warnings within an interface, and what methods to use to extract information about the strobing light sequences (e.g., crowdsourced or automated methods). In this work, we contribute a thematic analysis of crowdsourced warnings drawn from the DoesTheDogDie online forum and an interview study with five people who have been diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy about design considerations for photosensitivity warnings on digital platforms. To guide our interviews, we assembled examples of both crowdsourced and automated warnings about seizure-inducing content in films. Automated warnings were presented in the form of a high fidelity sketch demonstrating what an automated system for photosensitivity warnings might look like when deployed by a film streaming platform. We contribute design suggestions for the structure, content, and data sourcing of photosensitivity warnings for visual media based on the findings of our interviews. The results of this work will enable more effective and informative photosensitivity warnings across all forms of digital visual media."

However, this technology is not always accessible for people with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) who may experience seizures or other adverse symptoms when exposed to certain light stimuli (e.g., flashes or strobes). How can VR be made more inclusive and safer for people with PSE? In this paper, we report on a series of semi-structured interviews about current perceptions of accessibility in VR among people with PSE. We identify 12 barriers to accessibility that fall into four categories: physical VR equipment, VR interfaces and content, specific VR applications, and individual differences in sensitivity. Our findings allow researchers and practitioners to better understand the meaning of photosensitive accessibility in the context of VR, and provide a step towards enabling people with PSE to enjoy the benefits offered by immersive technology."

In so doing, we argue that the Kantian concept of categorical imperative does apply to social VR, that the reality of VR is not different from the reality of real life, and that what is morally unacceptable in real life is and should be unacceptable in social VR. In our framework, we provide three principles that can aid users and developers of social VR environments in reasoning about ethical issues in social VR, while advocating for more theoretical approaches to addressing the issue of VR ethics in human-computer interaction circles."

To better understand the design space for photosensitive risk warnings, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 265 crowdsourced warnings about flashing lights in films. We find that the crowdsourced warnings were tightly coupled to the scenic and temporal contexts of the films being described, unlike current practices for labeling media with potentially seizure-inducing sequences using general warnings that are not specific to the media at hand.

Our students need to be able to examine the social complexities in which technology development and use are situated. Also, aligning students' personal goals and their ability to achieve them in their field of study is important for promoting motivation and a sense of belonging. Promoting communal goals while learning computing can help broaden participation, particularly among groups who have been historically marginalized in computing. Keeping these considerations in mind, we piloted an introductory Java programming course in which activities engaging students in ethical and socially responsible considerations were integrated across modules. Rather than adding social on top of the technical content, our curricular approach seeks to weave them together. The data from the class suggests that the students found the inclusion of the social context in the technical assignments to be more motivating and expressed greater agency in realizing social change. We share our approach to designing this new introductory socially responsible computing course and the students' reflections. We also highlight seven considerations for educators seeking to incorporate socially responsible computing."

Whereas previous automated audio description (AD) systems provide single-tool approaches for delivering minimum viable description (MVD) or delivering on-demand visual question answering (VQA), we present a tandem AI-based AD tool that combines MVD and on-demand VQA. A user study with 26 BLV individuals explored how the tandem system may be used under the conditions of delivering MVD and/or on-demand VQA with AI-only or human-in-the-loop support. When each tool was used in isolation, AI-only conditions scored significantly lower in both user enjoyment and comprehension. When used in tandem, AI-only conditions matched outcomes delivered with human-in-the-loop, which suggests that AI-only AD tools may be most effective when both types of tools are used in tandem. A multimodal analysis of interactions with the tandem system revealed areas for system improvement in terms of the timing of AD delivery and accurate content delivery. We discuss how the use of both types of tools in a tandem system can mitigate some of the digital frictions that have plagued efforts in machine learning and automated tools for accessibility."

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return."

Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning ICML, 6818-6835. https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/daley23a.html","Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across λ λ -values in an off-policy control task."

Many such methods take the form of actor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access to the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being available at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are related to the effectiveness of different types of critics."

Learning Multi-Robot Decentralized Macro-Action-Based Policies via a Centralized Q-Net.","In many real-world multi-robot tasks, high-quality solutions often require a team of robots to perform asynchronous actions under decentralized control. Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have difficulty learning decentralized policies because of the environment appearing to be non-stationary due to other agents also learning at the same time. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a macro-action-based decentralized multi-agent double deep recurrent Q-net (MacDec-MADDRQN) which trains each decentralized Q-net using a centralized Q-net for action selection. A generalized version of MacDec-MADDRQN with two separate training environments, called Parallel-MacDec-MADDRQN, is also presented to leverage either centralized or decentralized exploration. The advantages and the practical nature of our methods are demonstrated by achieving near-centralized results in simulation and having real robots accomplish a warehouse tool delivery task in an efficient way."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM."

To test this, we measure linear approximation and causal intervention methods in GPT-J-6B to evaluate the degree to which individual hidden states in the network contain signal rich enough to predict future hidden states and, ultimately, token outputs. We find that, at some layers, we can approximate a model's output with more than 48% accuracy with respect to its prediction of subsequent tokens through a single hidden state.

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing.

By leveraging a multi-faceted feature set that includes geolocation data, we capture additional environmental context potentially linked to AD.

Our findings suggest that this combined approach can enhance the predictive accuracy of AD risk assessment, supporting early diagnosis and intervention in clinical settings. Additionally, the framework's ability to incorporate geolocation data provides a more comprehensive risk assessment model that could help healthcare providers better understand and address environmental factors contributing to AD development."

However, existing methods often fail to generate high-quality, impactful, and scalable CS, particularly across diverse linguistic contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enhance CS generation by aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages DPO to align LLM outputs with human preferences, ensuring contextually appropriate and linguistically adaptable responses. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge grounding to enhance the factual accuracy and relevance of generated CS. Experimental results demonstrate that DPO-aligned models significantly outperform SFT baselines on CS benchmarks while scaling effectively to multiple languages. These findings highlight the potential of preference-based alignment techniques to advance CS generation across varied linguistic settings. The model supervision and alignment is done in English and the same model is used for reporting metrics across other languages like Basque, Italian, and Spanish."

In this paper, we present a novel and highly efficient melanoma detection framework that synergistically combines the strengths of U-Net for segmentation and EfficientNet for the classification of skin images. The primary objective of our study is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of melanoma detection through an innovative hybrid approach. We utilized the HAM10000 dataset to meticulously train the U-Net model, enabling it to precisely segment cancerous regions. Concurrently, we employed the ISIC 2020 dataset to train the EfficientNet model, optimizing it for the binary classification of skin cancer. Our hybrid model demonstrates a significant improvement in performance, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.01% on the ISIC 2020 dataset. This exceptional result underscores the superiority of our approach compared to existing model structures. By integrating the precise segmentation capabilities of U-Net with the advanced classification prowess of EfficientNet, our framework offers a comprehensive solution for melanoma detection.

Moreover, the features that belong to each group, and the important feature groups may vary per sample. But what do we mean by feature redundancy? In this paper, we formally define two types of redundancies using information theory: \textit{Representation} and \textit{Relevant redundancies}. We leverage these redundancies to design a formulation for instance-wise feature group discovery and reveal a theoretical guideline to help discover the appropriate number of groups. We approximate mutual information via a variational lower bound and learn the feature group and selector indicators with Gumbel-Softmax in optimizing our formulation. Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical claims.

Unlike existing sequence alignment methods, which misalign actions in videos with different orderings, our POC loss efficiently aligns videos with same action orders and is differentiable, which enables end-to-end training. Our method efficiently learns the actions and their temporal locations, therefore, extends the existing attention- based action localization methods."

Robustness to such behaviour is an important consideration for data analysts in high-stakes scenarios such as cyber defense and counterterrorism. We find that, when the attacker has a sufficient budget, overlapping community detection methods outperform non-overlapping methods, often overwhelmingly so.

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity). There are also hypergraph generators, whose objective is to produce synthetic hypergraphs that are a faithful representation of real-world hypergraphs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of hypergraph mining, covering patterns, tools, and generators. We provide comprehensive taxonomies for each and offer in-depth discussions for future research on hypergraph mining."

An adversary that can manipulate the graph structure could alter traffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing traffic to a toll road). This article presents the Force Path Cut problem, in which an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the shortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that the optimization version of this problem is APX-hard but introduce PATHATTACK , a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path. We derive a nonconvex optimization formulation for these problems and derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We demonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic networks, illustrating where the proposed algorithms provide the greatest improvement over baseline methods."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

Recent work has shown that a malicious actor can manipulate a graph to make traffic between two nodes of interest follow their target path. In this paper, we develop a defense against such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose heuristic solutions based on increasing edge weights along target paths in both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum settings. Relaxing some constraints of the original problem, we formulate a linear program for local optimization around a feasible point.

The assembly of active molecules might have promoted the formation of large pre-biotic polymers that could be the precursors of the informational polymers we observe nowadays. Numerical simulations clearly show that self-propulsion considerably speeds up the assembly of polymers, somewhat in agreement with previous related studies. We conclude by discussing the differences between self-Assembly and self-Organization and discuss the role of self-propelled particles in the development of the self-organized system.

In the U.S. call the National Suicide Prevention Line on 1-800-273-8255. We show how a model that borrows some of these ideas can be used to study polymer formation from a collection of self-propelled monomers. We will not attempt to provide a theoretical description of the active self-assembly process presented here. Instead, we will present only numerical results obtained through molecular dynamics simulations. The motivation for studying the channel system is based on the hypothesis that the formation of organic macro-molecules relevant to the origin of life may have occurred in micro-channels formed either in meteorites [ 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ] or in confined micro-spaces of marine vent chimneys in which molecules are driven by thermal gradients. The results show that the external input of energy, via self-propulsion or other sources (such as ATP), can considerably enhance the assembly of structures. Propulsion considerably improves theassembly of molecules as compared to spontaneous self-assembly. At high temperatures, mostly monomers and dimers coexist, whereas longer polymer appear in negligible amounts. At low temperatures, the average polymer length does not reach a maximum at any value of the self-propulsion force. This is due to the aggregation of molecules and polymers next to the repulsive channel walls, which decreases the rate at which the chains grow. In the high-temperature regime, the system reaches a stationary state within the simulation time. In every case reported in Figure 4 , it can be seen that increasing 𝐹 sp F sp increases the growth rate of the polymer chains. The tail of the distribution reveals that much longer polymers are created. The narrower the channel, the less self- Propulsion force is needed to create long polymers. This effect clearly becomes stronger for narrow channels. The aggregation and jammingof active particles next to the confining Walls has been observed in both numerical simulations and experiments. Self-propulsion could have been an important mechanism for the formation of pre-biotic structures or the synthesis of nanometric structures. The model we have introduced takes into account the full geometry of the molecules by discretizing them into subunits. All authors have read and agree to the published version of the manuscript.

In this work, we explore an alternative perspective by augmenting reactive reviews with proactive forecasting. Specifically, we propose a new concept text toxicity propensity to characterize the extent to which a text tends to attract toxic comments. Beta regression is then introduced to do the probabilistic modeling, which is demonstrated to function well in comprehensive experiments. We also propose an explanation method to communicate the model decision clearly. Both propensity scoring and interpretation benefit text moderation in a novel manner. Finally, the proposed scaling mechanism for the linear model offers useful insights beyond this work."

Inspired by the recent success of the BERT model, we propose several modifications to BERT to enhance the performance on the downstream hatespeech classification task. HABERTOR inherits BERT’s architecture, but is different in four aspects: (i) it generates its own vocabularies and is pre-trained from the scratch using the largest scale hatespeech dataset; (ii) it consists of Quaternion-based factorized components, resulting in a much smaller number of parameters, faster training and inferencing, as well as less memory usage; (iii) it uses our proposed multi-source ensemble heads with a pooling layer for separate input sources, to further enhance its effectiveness; and (iv) it uses a regularized adversarial training with our proposed fine-grained and adaptive noise magnitude to enhance its robustness. Through experiments on the large-scale real-world hatespeech dataset with 1.4M annotated comments, we show that HABERTOR works better than 15 state-of-the-art hatespeech detection methods, including fine-tuning Language Models. In particular, comparing with BERT, our HABERTOR is 4 5 times faster in the training/inferencing phase, uses less than 1/3 of the memory, and has better performance, even though we pre-train it by using less than 1% of the number of words. Our generalizability analysis shows that HABERTOR transfers well to other unseen hatespeech datasets and is a more efficient and effective alternative to BERT for the hatespeech classification."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract The neural attention mechanism plays an important role in many natural language processing applications. In particular, multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. However, without explicit constraining, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model’s representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective. Based on the recently developed particle-optimization sampling techniques, we propose a non-parametric approach that explicitly improves the repulsiveness in multi-head attention and consequently strengthens model’s expressiveness. Remarkably, our Bayesian interpretation provides theoretical inspirations on the not-well-understood questions: why and how one uses multi-head attention. Extensive experiments on various attention models and applications demonstrate that the proposed repulsive attention can improve the learned feature diversity, leading to more informative representations with consistent performance improvement on multiple tasks."

Furthermore, the normalization involves the prediction of both operation types and token labels, enabling TNT to learn from more challenging tasks than the standard task of masked word recovery. As a result, the experiments demonstrate that TNT outperforms strong baselines on the hate speech classification task. Additional text normalization experiments and case studies show that TNT is a new potential approach to misspelling correction."

However, it is not clear whether the advantages of regions (e.g. better localization) are the key reasons for the success of bottom-up attention. In this paper, we revisit grid features for VQA, and find they can work surprisingly well -- running more than an order of magnitude faster with the same accuracy (e.g. if pre-trained in a similar fashion). Through extensive experiments, we verify that this observation holds true across different VQA models (reporting a state-of-the-art accuracy on VQA 2.0 test-std, 72.71), datasets, and generalizes well to other tasks like image captioning. As grid features make the model design and training process much simpler, this enables us to train them end-to-end and also use a more flexible network design. We learn VQA models end-to-end, from pixels directly to answers, and show that strong performance is achievable without using any region annotations in pre-training. We hope our findings help further improve the scientific understanding and the practical application of VQA. Code and features will be made available."

We assume that a large number of unlabeled videos from this domain are readily available. We automatically obtain labels on the target data by using high-confidence detections from the existing detector, augmented with hard (misclassified) examples acquired by exploiting temporal cues using a tracker. These automatically-obtained labels are then used for re-training the original model. A modified knowledge distillation loss is proposed, and we investigate several ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain. Our approach is empirically evaluated on challenging face and pedestrian detection tasks: a face detector trained on WIDER-Face, which consists of high-quality images crawled from the web, is adapted to a large-scale surveillance data set; a pedestrian detector trained on clear, daytime images from the BDD-100K driving data set is adapted to all other scenarios such as rainy, foggy, night-time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating hard examples obtained from tracking, the advantage of using soft-labels via distillation loss versus hard-labels, and show promising performance as a simple method for unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors, with minimal dependence on hyper-parameters."

However, when the size of the data stream drawn from the domain of the objective function is large or arrives very fast, one must privately optimize the objective within the constraints of the streaming setting. We establish fundamental differentially private baselines for this problem and then derive better trade-offs between privacy and utility for the special case of decomposable submodular functions. A submodular function is decomposable when it can be written as a sum of submodular functions; this structure arises naturally when each summand function models the utility of an individual and the goal is to study the total utility of the whole population as in the well-known Combinatorial Public Projects Problem.

Our algorithms automatically adapt to unknown problem parameters such as the smoothness and the norm of the operator, and the variance of the stochastic evaluation oracle. We show that our algorithms are universal and simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rates in the non-smooth, smooth, and stochastic settings. The convergence guarantees of our algorithms improve over existing adaptive methods and match the optimal non-adaptive algorithms. Additionally, prior works require that the optimization domain is bounded. In this work, we remove this restriction and give algorithms for unbounded domains that are adaptive and universal. Our general proof techniques can be used for many variants of the algorithm using one or two operator evaluations per iteration. The classical methods based on the ExtraGradient/MirrorProx algorithm require two operator evaluations per iteration, which is the dominant factor in the running time in many settings."

In this work, we develop a new streaming algorithm for maximizing a monotone k-submodular function subject to a per-coordinate cardinality constraint attaining an approximation guarantee close to the state of the art guarantee in the offline setting. Though not typical for streaming algorithms, our streaming algorithm also readily applies to the online setting with free disposal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and enjoys fast running time and small number of function evaluations. Furthermore, its guarantee improves as the cardinality constraints get larger, which is especially suited for the large scale applications. For the special case of maximizing a submodular function with large budgets, our combinatorial algorithm matches the guarantee of the state-of-the-art continuous algorithm, which requires significantly more time and function evaluations."

Diversity Measures for Niching Algorithms. Journal of Algorithms, Vol 14, Issue 2.","Swarm diversity measures can be used to quantify spread in niching algorithms. Niches are formed by a cluster of candidate solutions. A candidate niche can still be refined to find an actual solution, or optimum. An averaged candidate Niches’ diversity (SD diversity per niche) corresponds to the intra-niche distances. This article belongs to the Special Issue Benchmarking, Selecting and Configuring Learning and Optimization Algorithms. It is available as an Open Access PDF and can be read in the following formats: PDF with Cover, Epub, or PDF with Keyboard and Arrow, as well as the usual print and e-book formats. The adapted SDNN is shown in Appendix A , Appendix B and Appendix C. The results of the experiments are presented in Section 5.1. The average distance around the swarm centre (ADSC) computes the swarm diversity by calculating the average distance of particles to a central point in each dimension. A high SDNN value means that particles in a niche are far from each other. Low SDNN values may not indicate niche convergence because the calculated distance is only with respect to NNs and not entire members of a candidate niche. In the work presented here, the entropy measure value was normalised between 0 and 1. In this case, 1 represents high diversity while 0 represents no diversity. The work reported here, was calculated per niche, then averaged. 2.1.6 Solow–Polasky Diversity measure (SPD) The SPD measure relies on the use of the inverse of the matrix, M . The swarm center and the swarm coherence is similar to ADSC with the only exception that a further normalisation is carried out. Each candidate niche contains a neighbourhood best (i.e., the best candidate in a niche) Niche diversity refers to diversity with respect to the neighbourhood bests in each of the identified candidate niches. A good niching algorithm is expected to have a considerable high diversity both at the exploration and exploitation phases of the search process. However, niche diversity is still affected by such drawbacks as ‘outliers’ and niche identification strategies. The results for all the considered multimodal problems show that the diversity quantified using the standard SD is high. In conclusion, the standardSD is not suitable for niched algorithms. Diversity is not measured on how far apart the solutions are from each other but from the ‘swarm best’ which are multiple. As the particles converge towards optima, the diversity will decrease and then stagnate at a relatively high diversity value. The results of the study were published in the open-access issue of Theoretical Physics, published by the University of California, San Diego, on November 14, 2013. The embargo on this article has been lifted at the request of the author. The work presented here postulates that entropy is a suitable measure for quantifying dispersion for solutions and candidate solutions of niching algorithms. In summary, the nADAA is a useful measure to quantify the spread. of the solutions. of nICHing algorithms, while the mAD AA is a Useful measure to. quantify diversity within the candidate niches. Diversity measures are discussed with respect to the search space, i.e. swarm diversity, and with respect. to solution space,i.e., niche diversity. An empirical study involving the reviewed measures was carried out using a set of multimodal functions optimised using the enhanced species-based particle swarm optimisation (ESPSO) niching algorithm. The obtained diversity results showed that some measures are more suited to the task than others. High niche diversity during the exploration phase indicates that a niched algorithm is capable of identifying potential niches. It is, however, expected that niche diversity will decrease as the swarm moves from the exploration to the exploitation phase. The presented study can thus only be seen as a first step towards this investigation. The analysis of the population diversity of a swarm using a multi-objective search algorithm.

It is based on the E-meter, which has been shown to be more sensitive to changes in the environment than other measures such as the Pearson correlation coefficient (PE) or the Kruskal constant (K) The original version of this article stated that the results of the study werebased on the data for the SR measure. We are happy to clarify that the data was based on a different measure for theSR measure, and that the differences between the two measurements were due to the different weights.

K-means are the most popular clustering algorithms [51, 61]. This is because of their ability to adapt to new examples and to scale up to large datasets. They are also easily understandable and computationally faster [57, 60, 3, 62]. However, the number of clusters, K , has to be specified by the user [50]. Random process is the norm of searching for appropriate number of clusters, until convergence [53, 5]. Several variants of the k-means algorithm have been proposed, geared towards optimal selection of the K [8, 48]. The objective of this paper is to analyze the scaling up problems associated with these variants for optimizing K in the k-means clustering algorithms. Finally, a more enhanced ""hybrid autoencoder-based"" k-means will be developed and evaluated against the existing variants."

In this context, monitoring solar panel farms becomes essential for understanding and facilitating the worldwide shift toward clean energy. This study contributes to this effort by developing the first comprehensive global dataset of multispectral satellite imagery of solar panel farms. This dataset is intended to form the basis for training robust machine learning models, which can accurately map and analyze the expansion and distribution of solar panel farms globally.

The size and severity of wildfires in the region have been increasing in recent years, making it a pressing concern for communities, ecosystems, and the economy. The accurate and timely detection of active wildfires in remote areas is crucial for effective wildfire management and mitigation efforts. In this research paper, we propose a robust approach for detecting active wildfires using multispectral satellite imagery by leveraging vision transformers and a vast repository of landsat- 8 8 satellite data with a 30 30 m spatial resolution in North America. Our methodology involves experimenting with vision transformers and deep convolutional neural networks for wildfire detection in multispectral satellite images. We compare the capabilities of these two architecture families in detecting wildfires within the multispectral satellite imagery. Furthermore, we propose a novel u-shape vision transformer that effectively captures spatial dependencies and learns meaningful representations from multispectral images, enabling precise discrimination between wildfire and non-wildfire regions. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conducted experiments on a comprehensive dataset of wildfire incidents. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately detecting active wildfires with an \textit{Dice Score or F 1 1 } of and \textit{Recall} of . Overall, our research presents a promising approach for leveraging vision transformers for multispectral satellite imagery to detect remote wildfires."

Beyond this, PII may be added or removed from training datasets due to evolving dataset curation techniques, because they were newly scraped for retraining, or because they were included in a new downstream fine-tuning stage. We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as≈7.5×); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized. Model creators should consider these first- and second-order privacy risks when training models to avoid the risk of new PII regurgitation."

These missing portions or gaps are referred to as lacunae. In this study, we employ transformer-based optical character recognition (OCR) models trained on synthetic data containing lacunae in a supervised manner. We demonstrate their effectiveness in detecting and restoring lacunae, achieving a success rate of 65%, compared to a base model lacking knowledge of lacunae, which achieves only 5% restoration. Additionally, we investigate the mechanistic properties of the model, such as the log probability of transcription, which can identify lacunae and other errors (e.g., mistranscriptions due to complex writing or ink issues) in line images without directly inspecting the image. This capability could be valuable for scholars seeking to distinguish images containing lacunae or errors from clean ones. Although we explore the potential of attention mechanisms in flagging lacunae and transcription errors, our findings suggest it is not a significant factor. Our work highlights a promising direction in utilizing transformer-based OCR models for restoring or analyzing damaged historical documents."

Using recent developments in text-to-image generation models, such as DALLE mini, we propose computational methods that use generated images to measure the imageability of both single English words and connected text. We sample text prompts for image generation from three corpora: human-generated image captions, news article sentences, and poem lines. We subject these prompts to different deformances to examine the model's ability to detect changes in imageability caused by compositional change. We find high correlation between the proposed computational measures of imageability and human judgments of individual words. We also find the proposed measures more consistently respond to changes in compositionality than baseline approaches. We discuss possible effects of model training and implications for the study of compositionality in text-to-image models."

While most existing BCI systems employ character n-gram models or no LM at all, this paper adapts several wordpiece-level Transformer LMs to make character predictions and evaluates them on typing tasks.

We report here on an international collaboration that explored the interrelation between the reading record and the publications of the British philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill, focusing on his relationship with the London Library, an independent lending library of which Mill was a member for 32 years. Building on detailed archival research of the London Library’s lending and book donation records, a digital library of texts borrowed, and publications produced was assembled, which enabled natural language processing approaches to detect textual reuse and similarity, establishing the relationship between Mill and the Library. Text mining the books Mill borrowed and donated against his published outputs demonstrates that the collections of the London Library influenced his thought, transferred into his published oeuvre, and featured in his role as political commentator and public moralist. We reconceive archival library issue registers as data for triangulating against the growing body of digitized historical texts and the output of leading intellectual figures. We acknowledge, however, that this approach is dependent on the resources and permissions to transcribe extant library registers, and on access to previously digitized sources. Related copyright and privacy restrictions mean our approach is most likely to succeed for other leading eighteenth- and nineteenth-century figures.

We approach quotability identification as a passage ranking problem and evaluate how well both feature-based and BERT-based (Devlin et al., 2019) models rank the passages in a given document by their predicted quotability. We explore this problem through evaluations on five datasets that span multiple languages (English, Latin) and genres of literature (e.g. poetry, plays, novels) and whose corresponding derived documents are of multiple types (news, journal articles). Our experiments confirm the relatively strong performance of BERT-based models on this task, with the best model, a RoBERTA sequential sentence tagger, achieving an average rho of 0.35 and NDCG@1, 5, 50 of 0.26, 0.31 and 0.40, respectively, across all five datasets."

Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.

Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data. We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.

We introduce Energy Score, a proper scoring rule, to evaluate probabilistic predictions. We propose a novel deep dynamics model, Probabilistic Equivariant Continuous COnvolution (PECCO) for probabilistic prediction of multi-agent trajectories.

This network can be trained end-to-end with an equivariant task network to learn an explicitly symmetric representation. We validate this approach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3 distinct forms of symmetry. Our experiments demonstrate that SENs facilitate the application of equivariant networks to data with complex symmetry representations.

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making."

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

This paper considers predicting multiple node labeling functions on graphs simultaneously and revisits this problem from a multitask learning perspective. For a concrete example, consider overlapping community detection: each community membership is a binary node classification task. Due to complex overlapping patterns, we find that negative transfer is prevalent when we apply naive multitask learning to multiple community detection, as task relationships are highly nonlinear across different node labeling. To address the challenge, we develop an algorithm to cluster tasks into groups based on a higher-order task affinity measure. We then fit a multitask model on each task group, resulting in a boosting procedure on top of the baseline model. We estimate the higher-order task affinity measure between two tasks as the prediction loss of one task in the presence of another task and a random subset of other tasks. Then, we use spectral clustering on the affinity score matrix to identify task grouping. We design several speedup techniques to compute the higher-order affinity scores efficiently and show that they can predict negative transfers more accurately than pairwise task affinities. We validate our procedure using various community detection and molecular graph prediction data sets, showing favorable results compared with existing methods. Lastly, we provide a theoretical analysis to show that under a planted block model of tasks on graphs, our affinity scores can provably separate tasks into groups."

Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation, we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures. For example, on six image classification tasks whose training labels are generated with programmatic labeling, we show a 3.26% accuracy improvement over prior methods.

Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on correlations between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor performance on data groups without these correlations. This is challenging to address when the spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To improve worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training attribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach to directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM models can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a trained ERM model’s outputs to identify samples with the same class but dissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive learning to learn similar representations for these samples. To support CNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a representation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe that worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the alignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class’s worst-group vs. average error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss drastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average absolute lift. CNC is also competitive with oracle methods that require group labels."

When the capacity of the pre-trained model is much larger than the size of the target data set, fine-tuning is prone to overfitting and ""memorizing"" the training labels. Hence, an important question is to regularize fine-tuning and ensure its robustness to noise. To address this question, we begin by analyzing the generalization properties of fine-tuning. We present a PAC-Bayes generalization bound that depends on the distance traveled in each layer during fine-tuning and the noise stability of the fine-tuned model. We empirically measure these quantities. Based on the analysis, we propose regularized self-labeling---the interpolation between regularization and self-labeling methods, including (i) layer-wise regularization to constrain the distance traveled in each layer; (ii) self label-correction and label-reweighting to correct mislabeled data points (that the model is confident) and reweight less confident data points. We validate our approach on an extensive collection of image and text data sets using multiple pre-trained model architectures. Our approach improves baseline methods by 1.76% (on average) for seven image classification tasks and 0.75% for a few-shot classification task.

Sharp Bias-variance Tradeoffs of Hard Parameter Sharing in High-dimensional Linear Regression. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11750.","The problem of learning one task with samples from another task has received much interest recently. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: when is combining data from two tasks better than learning one task alone? Intuitively, the transfer effect from one task to another task depends on dataset shifts such as sample sizes and covariance matrices. However, quantifying such a transfer effect is challenging since we need to compare the risks between joint learning and single-task learning, and the comparative advantage of one over the other depends on the exact kind of dataset shift between both tasks. This paper uses random matrix theory to tackle this challenge in a linear regression setting with two tasks. We give precise asymptotics about the excess risks of some commonly used estimators in the high-dimensional regime, when the sample sizes increase proportionally with the feature dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics is provided as a function of the sample sizes and covariate/model shifts, which can be used to study transfer effects: In a random-effects model, we give conditions to determine positive and negative transfers between learning two tasks versus single-task learning; the conditions reveal intricate relations between dataset shifts and transfer effects. Simulations justify the validity of the asymptotics in finite dimensions. Our analysis examines several functions of two different sample covariance matrices, revealing some estimates that generalize classical results in the random matrix theory literature, which may be of independent interest."

Crowd-sourced sign language datasets, such as the ASL Citizen dataset, are great resources for improving accessibility and preserving linguistic diversity, but they must be used thoughtfully to avoid reinforcing existing biases.In this work, we utilize the rich information about participant demographics and lexical features present in the ASL Citizen dataset to study and document the biases that may result from models trained on crowd-sourced sign datasets. Further, we apply several bias mitigation techniques during model training, and find that these techniques reduce performance disparities without decreasing accuracy. With the publication of this work, we release the demographic information about the participants in the ASL Citizen dataset to encourage future bias mitigation work in this space."

Human evaluation shows that conversations in SODA are more consistent, specific, and (surprisingly) natural than those in prior human-authored datasets. Using SODA, we train COSMO: a generalizable conversation model that is significantly more natural and consistent on unseen datasets than best-performing conversation models (e.g., GODEL, BlenderBot-1, Koala, Vicuna). Experiments reveal COSMO is sometimes even preferred to the original human-written gold responses. Additionally, our results shed light on the distinction between knowledge-enriched conversations and natural social chitchats. We plan to make our data, model, and code public."

Abstract The ingrained principles of fairness in a dialogue system’s decision-making process and generated responses are crucial for user engagement, satisfaction, and task achievement. Absence of equitable and inclusive principles can hinder the formation of common ground, which in turn negatively impacts the overall performance of the system. For example, misusing pronouns in a user interaction may cause ambiguity about the intended subject. Yet, there is no comprehensive study of equitable text generation in dialogue. Aptly, in this work, we use theories of computational learning to study this problem. We provide formal definitions of equity in text generation, and further, prove formal connections between learning human-likeness and learning equity: algorithms for improving equity ultimately reduce to algorithms for improving human-likeness (on augmented data). With this insight, we also formulate reasonable conditions under which text generation algorithms can learn to generate equitable text without any modifications to the biased training data on which they learn. To exemplify our theory in practice, we look at a group of algorithms for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game and, using this example, test our theory empirically. Our theory accurately predicts relative-performance of multiple algorithms in generating equitable text as measured by both human and automated evaluation."

Abstract Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups."

Specifically: (1) Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) realizes consistently better downstream performance -- this means that no student ""reasoning"" is necessary at test time to realize gains. (2) When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements; performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens, for example.

We find that hyper-parameter tuning can improve this baseline by 9%. We examined 576 combinations of hyper-parameters: learning rate, batch size, epochs and date range of training data. Reasonable settings of learning rate and batch size produce better results than poor settings. Date range is less conclusive. Balancing the date range of the training data to match the benchmark ought to improve performance, but the differences are relatively small. Optimal settings of learning rate and batch size are much better than poor settings, but optimal settings of date range are not that different from poor settings of date range. Finally, we end with concerns about reproducibility. Of the 576 experiments, 10% produced F1 performance above baseline. It is common practice in the literature to run many experiments and report the best, but doing so may be risky, especially given the sensitive nature of Suicide Ideation Detection."

PLANT also shows remarkable data efficiency in few-shot scenarios, achieving precision comparable to traditional models with significantly less data. These results are achieved through key technical innovations: leveraging a pretrained Learning-to-Rank model as the planted attention layer, integrating mutual-information gain to enhance attention, introducing an inattention mechanism, and implementing a stateful-decoder to maintain context. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the importance of these contributions in realizing the performance gains."

We consider the problem of identifying from these newly released podcasts those with the largest potential audiences so they can be considered for personalized recommendation to users. We first study and then discard a supervised approach due to the inadequacy of either content or consumption features for this task and instead propose a novel non-contextual bandit algorithm in the fixed-budget infinitely armed pure-exploration setting. We demonstrate that our algorithm is well suited to the best-arm identification task for a broad class of arm reservoir distributions, out-competing a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms. We then apply the algorithm to identifying podcasts with broad appeal in a simulated study and show that it efficiently sorts podcasts into groups by increasing appeal while avoiding the popularity bias inherent in supervised approaches. Finally, we study a setting in which users are more likely to stream more-streamed podcasts independent of their general appeal and find that our proposed algorithm is robust to this type of popularity bias."

In this paper, we propose a new solution to query graph generation that works in the opposite manner: we start with the entire knowledge base and gradually shrink it to the desired query graph. This approach improves both the efficiency and the accuracy of query graph generation, especially for complex multi-hop questions.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present an adaptation of RNN sequence models to the problem of multi-label classification for text, where the target is a set of labels, not a sequence. Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task."

For very large values of n optimizing over an entire embedding breaks down, so we propose a novel method which first embeds a subset of m << n objects and then embeds the remaining objects independently and in parallel. We prove a distance error bound for our method in terms of m and that it has O(dn log m) time complexity, and show empirically that it is able to produce high quality embeddings in a fraction of the time needed for any published method."

For each assessor, we model assessor quality and bias in the form of Gaussian distributed class conditionals of relevance grades.

We estimate all parameters from crowdsourced data, demonstrating better inference of relevance as well as realistic models for both documents and assessors.

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes.

In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM."

We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing.

PLANT also shows remarkable data efficiency in few-shot scenarios, achieving precision comparable to traditional models with significantly less data.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract We present an adaptation of RNN sequence models to the problem of multi-label classification for text, where the target is a set of labels, not a sequence. Previous such RNN models define probabilities for sequences but not for sets; attempts to obtain a set probability are after-thoughts of the network design, including pre-specifying the label order, or relating the sequence probability to the set probability in ad hoc ways. Our formulation is derived from a principled notion of set probability, as the sum of probabilities of corresponding permutation sequences for the set. We provide a new training objective that maximizes this set probability, and a new prediction objective that finds the most probable set on a test document. These new objectives are theoretically appealing because they give the RNN model freedom to discover the best label order, which often is the natural one (but different among documents). We develop efficient procedures to tackle the computation difficulties involved in training and prediction. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that we outperform state-of-the-art methods for this task."

We estimate all parameters from crowdsourced data, demonstrating better inference of relevance as well as realistic models for both documents and assessors.

We find that the amount and ease of PII memorization is a dynamic property of a model that evolves throughout training pipelines and depends on commonly altered design choices. We characterize three such novel phenomena: (1) similar-appearing PII seen later in training can elicit memorization of earlier-seen sequences in what we call assisted memorization, and this is a significant factor (in our settings, up to 1/3); (2) adding PII can increase memorization of other PII significantly (in our settings, as much as≈7.5×); and (3) removing PII can lead to other PII being memorized.

These missing portions or gaps are referred to as lacunae. In this study, we employ transformer-based optical character recognition (OCR) models trained on synthetic data containing lacunae in a supervised manner. We demonstrate their effectiveness in detecting and restoring lacunae, achieving a success rate of 65%, compared to a base model lacking knowledge of lacunae, which achieves only 5% restoration. Additionally, we investigate the mechanistic properties of the model, such as the log probability of transcription, which can identify lacunae and other errors (e.g., mistranscriptions due to complex writing or ink issues) in line images without directly inspecting the image. This capability could be valuable for scholars seeking to distinguish images containing lacunae or errors from clean ones. Although we explore the potential of attention mechanisms in flagging lacunae and transcription errors, our findings suggest it is not a significant factor. Our work highlights a promising direction in utilizing transformer-based OCR models for restoring or analyzing damaged historical documents."

Using recent developments in text-to-image generation models, such as DALLE mini, we propose computational methods that use generated images to measure the imageability of both single English words and connected text. We sample text prompts for image generation from three corpora: human-generated image captions, news article sentences, and poem lines. We subject these prompts to different deformances to examine the model's ability to detect changes in imageability caused by compositional change. We find high correlation between the proposed computational measures of imageability and human judgments of individual words. We also find the proposed measures more consistently respond to changes in compositionality than baseline approaches. We discuss possible effects of model training and implications for the study of compositionality in text-to-image models."

Using language models to make character-level predictions, therefore, can greatly speed up BCI typing (Ghosh and Kristensson, 2017). While most existing BCI systems employ character n-gram models or no LM at all, this paper adapts several wordpiece-level Transformer LMs to make character predictions and evaluates them on typing tasks. GPT-2 fares best on clean text, but different LMs react differently to noisy histories. We further analyze the effect of character positions in a word and context lengths."

We report here on an international collaboration that explored the interrelation between the reading record and the publications of the British philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill, focusing on his relationship with the London Library, an independent lending library of which Mill was a member for 32 years. Building on detailed archival research of the London Library’s lending and book donation records, a digital library of texts borrowed, and publications produced was assembled, which enabled natural language processing approaches to detect textual reuse and similarity, establishing the relationship between Mill and the Library. Text mining the books Mill borrowed and donated against his published outputs demonstrates that the collections of the London Library influenced his thought, transferred into his published oeuvre, and featured in his role as political commentator and public moralist. We reconceive archival library issue registers as data for triangulating against the growing body of digitized historical texts and the output of leading intellectual figures. We acknowledge, however, that this approach is dependent on the resources and permissions to transcribe extant library registers, and on access to previously digitized sources. Related copyright and privacy restrictions mean our approach is most likely to succeed for other leading eighteenth- and nineteenth-century figures.

We approach quotability identification as a passage ranking problem and evaluate how well both feature-based and BERT-based (Devlin et al., 2019) models rank the passages in a given document by their predicted quotability. We explore this problem through evaluations on five datasets that span multiple languages (English, Latin) and genres of literature (e.g. poetry, plays, novels) and whose corresponding derived documents are of multiple types (news, journal articles). Our experiments confirm the relatively strong performance of BERT-based models on this task, with the best model, a RoBERTA sequential sentence tagger, achieving an average rho of 0.35 and NDCG@1, 5, 50 of 0.26, 0.31 and 0.40, respectively, across all five datasets."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Entity matching is the task of linking records from different sources that refer to the same real-world entity. Past work has primarily treated entity linking as a standard supervised learning problem. However, supervised entity matching models often do not generalize well to new data, and collecting exhaustive labeled training data is often cost prohibitive. Further, recent efforts have adopted LLMs for this task in few/zero-shot settings, exploiting their general knowledge. But LLMs are prohibitively expensive for performing inference at scale for real-world entity matching tasks.As an efficient alternative, we re-cast entity matching as a conditional generation task as opposed to binary classification. This enables us to “distill” LLM reasoning into smaller entity matching models via natural language explanations. This approach achieves strong performance, especially on out-of-domain generalization tests (10.85% F-1) where standalone generative methods struggle. We perform ablations that highlight the importance of explanations, both for performance and model robustness."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract LLMs process text as sequences of tokens that roughly correspond to words, where less common words are represented by multiple tokens. However, individual tokens are often semantically unrelated to the meanings of the words/concepts they comprise. For example, Llama-2-7b’s tokenizer splits the word “patrolling” into two tokens, “pat” and “rolling”, neither of which correspond to semantically meaningful units like “patrol” or ""-ing.” Similarly, the overall meanings of named entities like “Neil Young” and multi-word expressions like “break a leg” cannot be directly inferred from their constituent tokens. Mechanistically, how do LLMs convert such arbitrary groups of tokens into useful higher-level representations? In this work, we find that last token representations of named entities and multi-token words exhibit a pronounced “erasure” effect, where information about previous and current tokens is rapidly forgotten in early layers. Using this observation, we propose a method to “read out” the implicit vocabulary of an autoregressive LLM by examining differences in token representations across layers, and present results of this method for Llama-2-7b and Llama-3-8B. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to probe the implicit vocabulary of an LLM."

This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain. This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs—some general, others specialized—to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that—perhaps surprisingly—domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups."

FactPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, Llama-2, and Alpaca), with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level."

Second, we devise two methods for this task: end-to-end prompting of open-source and commercial language models, and a natural language inference pipeline. With a novel evaluation framework considering the correctness of QA pairs and their linguistic suitability, our expert evaluation reveals that models struggle to reliably identify information loss and applying similar standards as humans at what constitutes information loss."

Specifically: (1) Placing CoT sequences after labels (rather than before) realizes consistently better downstream performance -- this means that no student ""reasoning"" is necessary at test time to realize gains. (2) When rationales are appended in this way, they need not be coherent reasoning sequences to yield improvements; performance increases are robust to permutations of CoT tokens, for example.

In particular, we propose a Neural Additive Model to make predictions backed by evidence with individualized risk estimates at time-points where clinicians are still uncertain, aiming to specifically mitigate delays in diagnosis and errors stemming from an incomplete differential. To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual “true” diagnoses. We do so with LLMs, to ensure that the input text is from before a confident diagnosis can be made. We use an LLM to retrieve an initial pool of evidence, but then refine this set of evidence according to correlations learned by the model. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of the usefulness of our approach by simulating how it might be used by a clinician to decide between a pre-defined list of differential diagnoses."

We analyze how automated summarization evaluation metrics correlate with lexical features of generated summaries, to other automated metrics including several we propose in this work, and to aspects of human-assessed summary quality.

This is of particular interest in the medical domain, where alignments might highlight regions in an image relevant to specific phenomena described in free-text. While past work has suggested that attention “heatmaps” can be interpreted in this manner, there has been little evaluation of such alignments. We compare alignments from a state-of-the-art multimodal (image and text) model for EHR with human annotations that link image regions to sentences. Our main finding is that the text has an often weak or unintuitive influence on attention; alignments do not consistently reflect basic anatomical information. Moreover, synthetic modifications — such as substituting “left” for “right” — do not substantially influence highlights. Simple techniques such as allowing the model to opt out of attending to the image and few-shot finetuning show promise in terms of their ability to improve alignments with very little or no supervision.

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract The primary goal of drug safety researchers and regulators is to promptly identify adverse drug reactions. Doing so may in turn prevent or reduce the harm to patients and ultimately improve public health. Evaluating and monitoring drug safety (i.e., pharmacovigilance) involves analyzing an ever growing collection of spontaneous reports from health professionals, physicians, and pharmacists, and information voluntarily submitted by patients. In this scenario, facilitating analysis of such reports via automation has the potential to rapidly identify safety signals. Unfortunately, public resources for developing natural language models for this task are scant. We present PHEE, a novel dataset for pharmacovigilance comprising over 5000 annotated events from medical case reports and biomedical literature, making it the largest such public dataset to date. We describe the hierarchical event schema designed to provide coarse and fine-grained information about patients’ demographics, treatments and (side) effects. Along with the discussion of the dataset, we present a thorough experimental evaluation of current state-of-the-art approaches for biomedical event extraction, point out their limitations, and highlight open challenges to foster future research in this area."

We explore the implications of this phenomenon for model fairness across demographic groups in clinical prediction tasks over electronic health records (EHR) in MIMIC-III —— the standard dataset in clinical NLP research. Apparent subgroup performance varies substantially for seeds that yield similar overall performance, although there is no evidence of a trade-off between overall and subgroup performance. However, we also find that the small sample sizes inherent to looking at intersections of minority groups and somewhat rare conditions limit our ability to accurately estimate disparities. Further, we find that jointly optimizing for high overall performance and low disparities does not yield statistically significant improvements. Our results suggest that fairness work using MIMIC-III should carefully account for variations in apparent differences that may arise from stochasticity and small sample sizes."

By combining digital laboratory notebooks with performance data from 2,406 teams over multiple years of participation, we reveal shared dynamical and organizational patterns across teams and identify features associated with team performance and success.

Here, we rely on unsupervised interpretable machine learning applied to the full text of each paper to systematically identify hidden citations. We find that for influential discoveries hidden citations outnumber citation counts, emerging regardless of publishing venue and discipline. We show that the prevalence of hidden citations is not driven by citation counts, but rather by the degree of the discourse on the topic within the text of the manuscripts, indicating that the more discussed is a discovery, the less visible it is to standard bibliometric analysis. Hidden citations indicate that bibliometric measures offer a limited perspective on quantifying the true impact of a discovery, raising the need to extract knowledge from the full text of the scientific corpus."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

To explore the degree to which this capability has materialized, we extract meta-data from 356,403 clinical trials spanning four decades, aiming to offer mechanistic insights into the innovation practices in drug discovery. We find that convention dominates over innovation, as over 96% of the recorded trials focus on previously tested drug targets, and the tested drugs target only 12% of the human interactome. If current patterns persist, it would take 170 years to target all druggable proteins. We uncover two network-based fundamental mechanisms that currently limit target discovery: preferential attachment, leading to the repeated exploration of previously targeted proteins; and local network effects, limiting exploration to proteins interacting with highly explored proteins. We build on these insights to develop a quantitative network-based model of drug discovery. We demonstrate that the model is able to accurately recreate the exploration patterns observed in clinical trials. Most importantly, we show that a network-based search strategy can widen the scope of drug discovery by guiding exploration to novel proteins that are part of under explored regions in the human interactome."

We identify nearly one million grants supporting institutions involved in science and higher education, finding that in volume and scope, philanthropic funding has grown to become comparable to federal research funding. Yet, distinct from government support, philanthropic funders tend to focus locally, indicating that criteria beyond research excellence play an important role in funding decisions.

Finally, we leverage the bipartite network of supporters and recipients to help us demonstrate the predictive power of the underlying network in foreseeing future funder-recipient relationships.

While deep learning models have been proposed to accelerate the identification process, we show that state-of-the-art models fail to generalize to novel (i.e., never-before-seen) structures. We first unveil the mechanisms responsible for this shortcoming, demonstrating how models rely on shortcuts that leverage the topology of the protein-ligand bipartite network, rather than learning the node features. Then, we introduce AI-Bind, a pipeline that combines network-based sampling strategies with unsupervised pre-training, allowing us to limit the annotation imbalance and improve binding predictions for novel proteins and ligands. We illustrate the value of AI-Bind by predicting drugs and natural compounds with binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and the associated human proteins. We also validate these predictions via docking simulations and comparison with recent experimental evidence, and step up the process of interpreting machine learning prediction of protein-ligand binding by identifying potential active binding sites on the amino acid sequence. Overall, AI-Bind offers a powerful high-throughput approach to identify drug-target combinations, with the potential of becoming a powerful tool in drug discovery."

We find that GCNs are rather restrictive in learning graph moments. Without careful design, GCNs can fail miserably even with multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions. We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs, arriving at a modular GCN design, using different propagation rules. Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs, a notoriously difficult problem in network science. Our investigation suggests that, depth is much more influential than width and deeper GCNs are more capable of learning higher order graph moments. Additionally, combining GCN modules with different propagation rules is critical to the representation power of GCNs."

For example, when modeling collaboration networks, which may involve not just two but three or more people, the use of hypergraphs allows us to explore beyond pairwise (dyadic) patterns and capture groupwise (polyadic) patterns. The mathematical complexity of hypergraphs offers both opportunities and challenges for hypergraph mining. The goal of hypergraph mining is to find structural properties recurring in real-world hypergraphs across different domains, which we call patterns. To find patterns, we need tools. We divide hypergraph mining tools into three categories: (1) null models (which help test the significance of observed patterns), (2) structural elements (i.e., substructures in a hypergraph such as open and closed triangles), and (3) structural quantities (i.e., numerical tools for computing hypergraph patterns such as transitivity).

An adversary that can manipulate the graph structure could alter traffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing traffic to a toll road). This article presents the Force Path Cut problem, in which an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the shortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that the optimization version of this problem is APX-hard but introduce PATHATTACK , a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path. We derive a nonconvex optimization formulation for these problems and derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We demonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic networks, illustrating where the proposed algorithms provide the greatest improvement over baseline methods."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

Recent work has shown that a malicious actor can manipulate a graph to make traffic between two nodes of interest follow their target path. In this paper, we develop a defense against such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose heuristic solutions based on increasing edge weights along target paths in both the zero-sum and non-zero-sum settings. Relaxing some constraints of the original problem, we formulate a linear program for local optimization around a feasible point. We present defense results with both synthetic and real network datasets and show that these methods often reach the lower bound of the defender's cost."

By aggregating user demographic information onto the domains, we derive five metrics that provide critical insights into over 129,000 websites. In particular, the localness and partisan audience metrics quantify the domains' geographical reach and ideological orientation, respectively. These metrics show substantial agreement with existing classifications, suggesting the effectiveness and reliability of DomainDemo's approach."

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption."

These approaches fail to capture another potential form of misinformation with a much larger audience: factual news from mainstream sources ('real' news) repurposed to promote false or misleading narratives. We operationalize narratives using an existing unsupervised NLP technique and examine the narratives present in misinformation content. We find that certain articles from reliable outlets are shared by a disproportionate number of users who also shared fake news on Twitter. We consider these 'real' news articles to be co-shared with fake news. We show that co-shared articles contain existing misinformation narratives at a significantly higher rate than articles from the same reliable outlets that are not co-shared with fake news. This holds true even when articles are chosen following strict criteria of reliability for the outlets and after accounting for the alternative explanation of partisan curation of articles. For example, we observe that a recent article published by The Washington Post titled ""Vaccinated people now make up a majority of COVID deaths"" was disproportionately shared by Twitter users with a history of sharing anti-vaccine false news reports. Our findings suggest a strategic repurposing of mainstream news by conveyors of misinformation as a way to enhance the reach and persuasiveness of misleading narratives. We also conduct a comprehensive case study to help highlight how such repurposing can happen on Twitter as a consequence of the inclusion of particular narratives in the framing of mainstream news."

Engagement Outweighs Exposure to Partisan and Unreliable News within Google Search CoRR, abs/2201.00074. https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00074","If popular online platforms systematically expose their users to partisan and unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues like rising political polarization. This concern is central to the echo chamber and filter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information sources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the URLs seen while using an online platform, and engagement, the URLs selected while on that platform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of obtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their regular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data, or estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their centrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have focused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and engagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. We found that participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent relationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed to on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results they chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall engagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed to on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news sources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall. These results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable news on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by users' own choices."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Stance detection, which aims to determine whether an individual is for or against a target concept, promises to uncover public opinion from large streams of social media data. Yet even human annotation of social media content does not always capture “stance” as measured by public opinion polls. We demonstrate this by directly comparing an individual’s self-reported stance to the stance inferred from their social media data. Leveraging a longitudinal public opinion survey with respondent Twitter handles, we conducted this comparison for 1,129 individuals across four salient targets. We find that recall is high for both “Pro’’ and “Anti’’ stance classifications but precision is variable in a number of cases. We identify three factors leading to the disconnect between text and author stance: temporal inconsistencies, differences in constructs, and measurement errors from both survey respondents and annotators. By presenting a framework for assessing the limitations of stance detection models, this work provides important insight into what stance detection truly measures."

In this study, we conduct a targeted algorithm audit of Google Search using a dynamic set of political queries. We designed a Chrome extension to survey participants and collect the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and autocomplete suggestions that they would have been exposed to while searching our set of political queries during the month after Donald Trump»s Presidential inauguration.

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more -- both farther and faster -- on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, then it should spread more on random networks without such redundancies. We develop a novel model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks better spread a behavior compared to random networks. Using both simulations and analytical techniques we find precise boundaries in the parameter space where either network type outperforms the other or performs equally. We find that in most cases, random networks spread a behavior equally as far or farther compared to clustered networks despite strong social reinforcement. While there are regions in which clustered networks better diffuse contagions with social reinforcement, this only holds when the diffusion process approaches that of a deterministic threshold model and does not hold for all socially reinforced behaviors more generally. At best, clustered networks only outperform random networks by at least a five percent margin in 18\% of the parameter space, and when social reinforcement is large relative to the baseline probability of adoption."

CoRR, abs/2404.14141. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2404.14141","Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed problem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities and evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a tension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the contest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The competitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to their self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their peers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless on 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000 individuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative explanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this tension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly competitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest competitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when high-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not directly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level use of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level outcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term participation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to participate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This suggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future participation. These findings have important implications for the literature on crowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing communities."

In this multi-study research, we quantify ideators' preferences for non-cash incentives and investigate how allowing ideators to self-select their preferred incentive -- offering ideators a choice between cash and non-cash incentives -- affects their creative performance. We further explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest -- social (non-profit) or monetary (for-profit) -- moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness. We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives, such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators' preferences (and the ability to satisfy diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives. We provide managers with guidance to design effective incentives by improving incentive-preference fit for ideators."

By manipulating both, we reveal mechanisms of perception and clarify ambiguity in previous work. Our results show that the human resemblance of a voice assistant's voice negatively interacts with the helpfulness of an agent's contribution to flip its effect on perceived anthropomorphism and perceived animacy. This means human teammates interpret the agent's contributions differently depending on its voice. Our study found no significant effect of voice on perceived intelligence, trustworthiness, or team performance. We find differences in these measures are caused by manipulating the helpfulness of an agent.

We analyzed ten years of data from an online innovation community that crowdsourced 136,989 design submissions from 33,813 individuals. We leveraged data from two types of design contests-creatively constrained and unconstrained-running in parallel on the platform, and we evaluated a natural experiment where a platform change reduced technical constraints.

First, signaling interactions in dynamic networks are sufficient to cause the endogenous formation of distinct signaling groups, even in an initially homogeneous population. Second, dynamic networks allow the emergence of novel {\em hybrid} signaling groups that do not converge on a single common signaling system but are instead composed of different yet complementary signaling strategies. We show that the presence of these hybrid groups promotes stable diversity in signaling among other groups in the population. Third, we find important distinctions in information processing capacity of different groups: hybrid groups diffuse information more quickly initially but at the cost of taking longer to reach all group members.

While deep surrogate models can speed up the simulations, doing so for stochastic simulations and with active learning approaches is an underexplored area. We propose Interactive Neural Process (INP), a deep Bayesian active learning framework for learning deep surrogate models to accelerate stochastic simulations. INP consists of two components, a spatiotemporal surrogate model built upon Neural Process (NP) family and an acquisition function for active learning. For surrogate modeling, we develop Spatiotemporal Neural Process (STNP) to mimic the simulator dynamics. For active learning, we propose a novel acquisition function, Latent Information Gain (LIG), calculated in the latent space of NP based models. We perform a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that LIG reduces sample complexity compared with random sampling in high dimensions. We also conduct empirical studies on three complex spatiotemporal simulators for reaction diffusion, heat flow, and infectious disease. The results demonstrate that STNP outperforms the baselines in the offline learning setting and LIG achieves the state-of-the-art for Bayesian active learning."

Recommender systems and assistants play a prominent role in human-AI coevolution, as they permeate many facets of daily life and influence human choices on online platforms. The interaction between users and AI results in a potentially endless feedback loop, wherein users' choices generate data to train AI models, which, in turn, shape subsequent user preferences. This human-AI feedback loop has peculiar characteristics compared to traditional human-machine interaction and gives rise to complex and often ``unintended'' social outcomes. This paper introduces Coevolution AI as the cornerstone for a new field of study at the intersection between AI and complexity science focused on the theoretical, empirical, and mathematical investigation of the human-AI feedback loop. In doing so, we: (i) outline the pros and cons of existing methodologies and highlight shortcomings and potential ways for capturing feedback loop mechanisms; (ii) propose a reflection at the intersection between complexity science, AI and society; (iii) provide real-world examples for different human-AI ecosystems; and (iv) illustrate challenges to the creation of such a field of study, conceptualising them at increasing levels of abstraction, i.e., technical, epistemological, legal and socio-political."

Motivational interviewing is a collaborative counseling style in which patients are guided to talk about changing their behavior, with empathetic counseling an essential ingredient. We developed and evaluated an LLM-powered training system that features a simulated patient and visualizations of turn-by-turn performance feedback tailored to the needs of counselors learning motivational interviewing.

We report the results of a randomized clinical trial with 240 patients experiencing atrial fibrillation who were provided with smartphones and heart rhythm sensors for 4 months. Participants in the intervention group interacted with a virtual agent, while the control group received general health education via the WebMD app. Intervention participants completed a median 91 interactions with the agent over the 4 months of the study period, and agent features designed to increase engagement–such as storytelling–were effective at increasing use. The agent’s promotion of heart rhythm sensor use was effective, with intervention participants taking significantly more heart rhythm readings compared to those in the control group.

Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust. Our work highlights the role of emotion awareness and multimodality in generating appropriate grounding moves for conversational agents."

Others use a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. We view these two designs as ends of a spectrum and explore a middle-ground approach that enables efficient learning of diverse behaviors. Inspired by work in transfer learning and meta RL, and building upon prior work in trait-based task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a general-purpose soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to enable a single architecture to dynamically adapt to each robot and the current context. Intuitively, CASH encodes shared decision making strategies that can be adapted to each robot based on local observations and the robots' individual and collective capabilities (e.g., speed and payload). CASH explicitly captures the impact of capabilities on collective behavior, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. We conducted experiments across four heterogeneous coordination tasks and three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL) using SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, CASH generates appropriately diverse behaviors and outperforms baseline architectures in task performance and sample efficiency during training and zero-shot generalization while utilizing 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters."

To improve image quality, image stabilizers with inertial sensors are added to reduce image blurring caused by camera jitters. This trend creates a new attack surface. By emitting deliberately designed acoustic signals, an adversary can control the output of an inertial sensor, which triggers unnecessary motion compensation and results in a blurred image. These blurred images can induce object misclassification, affecting safety-critical decision-making. We model the feasibility of such acoustic manipulation and design an attack framework that can accomplish three types of attacks."

While conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are adept at tracking diverse objects, toddlers pose unique challenges due to their unpredictable movements, various poses, and similar appearance.

In this paper, we address the challenges of MTT and propose MTTSort, a customized method built upon the DeepSort algorithm. MTTSort is designed to track multiple toddlers in indoor videos accurately. Our contributions include discussing the primary challenges in MTT, introducing a genetic algorithm to optimize hyperparameters, proposing an accurate tracking algorithm, and curating the MTTrack dataset using unbiased AI co-labeling techniques. We quantitatively compare MTTSort to state-of-the-art MOT methods on MTTrack, DanceTrack, and MOT15 datasets. In our evaluation, the proposed method outperformed other MOT methods, achieving 0.98, 0.68, and 0.98 in multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA), and iterative and discriminative framework 1 (IDF1) metrics, respectively."

One barrier to clinical (or algorithmic) assessment of NNS stems from its sparsity, requiring experts to wade through hours of footage to find minutes of relevant activity. Our NNS activity segmentation algorithm solves this problem by identifying periods of NNS with high certainty -- up to 94.0\% average precision and 84.9\% average recall across 30 heterogeneous 60 s clips, drawn from our manually annotated NNS clinical in-crib dataset of 183 hours of overnight baby monitor footage from 19 infants.

In the present study, we both extend and enhance these prior results through the use of principal component analysis and a nonlinear kernel-based classifier (Support Vector Machines). Our results illustrate that these newly applied methods yield significant improvements, predicting aggression up to 3 minutes before it occurs with an average AUC of 0.98 in both population and individual models. Furthermore, we extend our prior work by evaluating aggression prediction performance across varying observed aggression intensities and find that moderate and high intensity aggression episodes are detectable with 2 to 5% higher average AUC than low-intensity aggression episodes."

Facial expressions are a sensitive, specific biomarker of the presence and severity of pain, and computer vision (CV) and machine-learning (ML) techniques enable reliable, valid measurement of pain-related facial expressions from video. We developed and evaluated a CVML approach to measure pain-related facial expressions for automated pain assessment in youth. Methods: A CVML-based model for assessment of pediatric postoperative pain was developed from videos of 50 neurotypical youth 5 to 18 years old in both endogenous/ongoing and exogenous/transient pain conditions after laparoscopic appendectomy. Model accuracy was assessed for self-reported pain ratings in children and time since surgery, and compared with by-proxy parent and nurse estimates of observed pain in youth. Results: Model detection of pain versus no-pain demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.84-0.94) in both ongoing and transient pain conditions. Model detection of pain severity demonstrated moderate-to-strong correlations (r = 0.65-0.86 within; r = 0.47-0.61 across subjects) for both pain conditions. The model performed equivalently to nurses but not as well as parents in detecting pain versus no-pain conditions, but performed equivalently to parents in estimating pain severity. Nurses were more likely than the model to underestimate youth self-reported pain ratings. Demographic factors did not affect model performance. Conclusions: CVML pain assessment models derived from automatic facial expression measurements demonstrated good-to-excellent accuracy in binary pain classifications, strong correlations with patient self-reported pain ratings, and parent-equivalent estimation of children's pain levels over typical pain trajectories in youth after appendectomy."

Despite the critical need for early detection of these mental health symptoms, clinicians often face challenges in accurately collecting patients' mental health data and making clinical decision-making in a timely manner. Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

EMAs allow for temporally dense, ecologically valid data collection, but frequent interruptions with lengthy surveys on mobile devices can burden users, impacting compliance and data quality. We propose a method that reduces the length of each EMA question set measuring interrelated constructs, with only modest information loss. By estimating the potential information gain of each EMA question using question-answer prediction models, this method can prioritize the presentation of the most informative question in a question-by-question sequence and skip uninformative questions. We evaluated the proposed method by simulating question omission using four real-world datasets from three different EMA studies. When compared against the random question omission approach that skips 50% of the questions, our method reduces imputation errors by 15%-52%. In surveys with five answer options for each question, our method can reduce the mean survey length by 34%-56% with a real-time prediction accuracy of 72%-95% for the skipped questions. The proposed method may either allow more constructs to be surveyed without adding user burden or reduce response burden for more sustainable longitudinal EMA data collection."

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

We assessed barriers to PA and how context-aware communication could help overcome them. Participants with SCI expressed that PA tracking and communication technologies must be tailored to their specific needs. Further analysis revealed that context-aware messaging could help participants with SCI connect with others to initiate timely conversations about overcoming PA barriers, and to provide encouragement to meet their PA goals.

Prior work shows that even when μEMA interrupts far more frequently than smartphone-EMA, μEMA yields higher response rates with lower burden. We examined the contextual biases associated with non-response of μEMA prompts on a smartwatch. Based on prior work on EMA non-response and smartwatch use, we identified 10 potential contextual biases from three categories: temporal (time of the day, parts of waking day, day of the week, and days in study), device use (screen state, charging status, battery mode, and phone usage), and activity (wrist motion and location). We used data from a longitudinal study where 131 participants (Mean age 22.9 years, SD = 3.0) responded to μEMA surveys on a smartwatch for at least six months. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, we found that all temporal, activity/mobility, and device use variables had a statistically significant (p<0.001) association with momentary μEMA non-response. We discuss the implication of these results for future use of context-aware μEMA methodology."

EMA has a key limitation: interruption burden. Microinteraction-EMA(µEMA) may reduce burden without sacrificing high temporal density of measurement. In µEMA, all EMA prompts can be answered with ‘at a glance' microinteractions. In a prior 4-week pilot study comparing standard EMA delivered on a phone (phone-EMA) vs. µEMA delivered on a smartwatch (watch-µEMA), watch-µEMA demonstrated higher response rates and lower perceived burden than phone-EMA, even when the watch-µEMA interruption rate was 8 times more than phone-EMA. A new 4-week dataset was gathered on smartwatch-based EMA (i.e., watch-EMA with 6 back-to-back, multiple-choice questions on a watch) to compare whether the high response rates of watch-µEMA previously observed were a result of using microinteractions, or due to the novelty and accessibility of the smartwatch. No statistically significant differences in compliance, completion, and first-prompt response rates were observed between phone-EMA and watch-EMA. However, watch-µEMA response rates were significantly higher than watch-EMA. This pilot suggests that (1) the high compliance and low burden previously observed in watch-µEMA is likely due to the microinteraction question technique, not simply the use of the watch versus the phone, and that (2) compliance with traditional EMA (with long surveys) may not improve simply by moving survey delivery from the phone to a smartwatch."

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with university students to understand the unique challenges in the mental health medication management process and their coping strategies, particularly examining the role of various technologies in this process. We discovered that due to struggles with self-acceptance and the interdependent relationship between medication, symptoms, schedules, and life changes, the medication management process for students was a highly dynamic journey involving frequent dosage changes.

Effective clinical decision-making, including the detection of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and the monitoring of associated symptoms, remains a challenging task for clinicians. This study investigates the current practices and needs of clinicians in the clinical decision making of cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity and explores the potential of digital health technologies to support this process. Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making."

To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. Toward this, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is slow, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of this workshop for the last five years, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in developing a holistic approach for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health."

For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions. We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study."

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3448116","Recent developments of novel in-vehicle interventions show the potential to transform the otherwise routine and mundane task of commuting into opportunities to improve the drivers' health and well-being. Prior research has explored the effectiveness of various in-vehicle interventions and has identified moments in which drivers could be interruptible to interventions. All the previous studies, however, were conducted in either simulated or constrained real-world driving scenarios on a pre-determined route. In this paper, we take a step forward and evaluate when drivers interact with in-vehicle interventions in unconstrained free-living conditions. To this end, we conducted a two-month longitudinal study with 10 participants, in which each participant was provided with a study car for their daily driving needs. We delivered two in-vehicle interventions - each aimed at improving affective well-being - and simultaneously recorded the participants' driving behavior. In our analysis, we found that several pre-trip characteristics (like trip length, traffic flow, and vehicle occupancy) and the pre-trip affective state of the participants had significant associations with whether the participants started an intervention or canceled a started intervention. Next, we found that several in-the-moment driving characteristics (like current road type, past average speed, and future brake behavior) showed significant associations with drivers' responsiveness to the intervention. Further, we identified several driving behaviors that ""negated"" the effectiveness of interventions and highlight the potential of using such ""negative"" driving characteristics to better inform intervention delivery. Finally, we compared trips with and without intervention and found that both interventions employed in our study did not have a negative effect on driving behavior. Based on our analyses, we provide solid recommendations on how to deliver interventions to maximize responsiveness and effectiveness and minimize the burden on the drivers."

DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3432220","Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-the-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress. There is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions."

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

In this 2-month qualitative study, we investigated PA tracking practices amongst 14 families living in low-income neighborhoods, where obesity is prevalent. We characterize how social discussions of PA data rarely extended beyond the early stages of experiential learning, thus limiting the utility of PA trackers. Caregivers and children rarely analyzed their experiences to derive insights about the meaning of their PA data for their wellbeing. Those who engaged in these higher-order learning processes were often influenced by parenting beliefs shaped by personal health experiences. We contribute recommendations for how technology can more effectively support family experiential learning using PA tracking data."

However, more work is needed to understand how PA trackers are perceived and adopted by low-SES families, where PA may be deprioritized due to economic stresses, limited resources, and perceived crime. Accordingly, we conducted a two-month, in-depth qualitative study, exploring low-SES caregivers' perspectives on PA tracking and promotion. Our findings show how PA tracking was impacted by caregivers' attitudes toward safety, which were influenced by how they perceived social connections within their neighborhoods; and cognitive-emotional processes.

Recent work aims to leverage automated algorithms to perform sleep staging not based on electroencephalogram signals, but rather based on the airflow signals of subjects. Prior work uses ideas from topological data analysis (TDA), specifically Hermite function expansions of persistence curves (HEPC) to featurize airflow signals. However, finite order HEPC captures only partial information. In this work, we propose Fourier approximations of persistence curves (FAPC), and use this technique to perform sleep staging based on airflow signals. We analyze performance using an XGBoost model on 1155 pediatric sleep studies taken from the Nationwide Children's Hospital Sleep DataBank (NCHSDB), and find that FAPC methods provide complimentary information to HEPC methods alone, leading to a 4.9% increase in performance over baseline methods."

Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication. Sleep disturbances in depression can lead to increased risk of depression and anxiety. Short sleep duration is associated with reduced leptin, elevated ghrelin, and increased body mass index. Sleep efficiency is a metric to measure the quality of a person's sleep, and it can be as important as sleep quantity or quality. We tested the feasibility of predicting poor or good sleep efficiency based on physical activity data from the awake periods from a wearable device (ie, actigraphy) We took a detour from classical methods and proposed deep learning approaches to modeling the relationship between sleep and physical activity. The deidentified data used in this study were collected by Weill Cornell Medical College-Qatar for a research study called Qatar’s Ultimate Education for Sleep in Teenagers. The aim of the study was to determine different sleep patterns in adolescents residing in Qatar and how these related to body weight status. After agreeing to participate in the study, the adolescent participants were provided with an ActiGraph GT3X+ device, placed on their nondominant wrist, and were instructed to wear it at all times for 7 consecutive days and nights. The raw accelerometer data was aggregated into minute-by-minute epochs using a script written in R version 3.3.1. We compared the results of our deep learning models to those of logistic regression. Time-batched LSTM, CNN, and MLP performed the best with AUC scores showing an improvement over LR by 50%, 46%, and 46%, respectively. “Only the simple RNN performed worse than logistic regression in both F1-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) and accuracy,” the authors wrote in the paper. The deep learning methods of CNN and TB-lSTM were the best performers overall. Their sensitivity (0.97 and 1) showed that these models were able to detect nearly all the cases of “good-quality sleep” The sensitivity (also known as recall), and specificity of each of the models are reported in Table 2. This classification is consequently not an indicator of sleep patterns, but the prediction of a sleep quality parameter that might indicate a potential sleep problem. Deep learning performed better than classical methods in terms of learning useful patterns from raw accelerometer data for the task of sleep quality prediction. Our focus on predicting and forecasting can help design new eHealth applications where predictions are made to personalize coaching for patients or to facilitate decision making of professionals. The expansion of eHealth into sleep is not limited to sleep disorders, but also to improve sleep for people living with chronic conditions such as cancer. To maximize the potential of the wearable mass adoption for sleep health, we need research on not only the reliability of consumer-grade devices but also their data processing and modeling techniques. The study provided an early example of how advanced deep learning methods could be used to infer new insights from raw actigraphY data. It is hoped that this research will lead to a paradigm shift in the study of lifestyle behaviors such as sleep and physical activity.

To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Retain XML formatting tags such as <tex-math>. Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

Through semi-structured interviews with seven clinical experts, we identify a three-step decision-making paradigm: 1) symptom identification, 2) diagnostic testing and specialist collaboration, and 3) clinical decision-making and intervention. Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities. Based on these insights, we discuss the importance of understanding the dynamic nature of clinical workflows, and the design considerations for future digital tools to support cancer-treatment-induced cardiotoxicity decision-making."

However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

These rules are relied upon by compilers, libraries, and foreign-function interfaces. Unfortunately, ABIs are typically specified in prose, and while type systems for source languages have evolved, ABIs have comparatively stalled, lacking advancements in expressivity and safety. We propose a vision for richer, semantic ABIs to improve interoperability and library integration, supported by a methodology for formally specifying ABIs using realizability models. These semantic ABIs connect abstract, high-level types to unwieldy, but well-behaved, low-level code. We illustrate our approach with a case study formalizing the ABI of a functional source language in terms of a reference-counting implementation in a C-like target language. A key contribution supporting this case study is a graph-based model of separation logic that captures the ownership and accessibility of reference-counted resources using modalities inspired by hybrid logic. To highlight the flexibility of our methodology, we show how various design decisions can be interpreted into the semantic ABI. Finally, we provide the first formalization of library evolution, a distinguishing feature of Swift’s ABI."

On the other hand, recently developed probabilistic separation logics decompose state via relatively unfamiliar measure-theoretic constructions for computing unions of sigma-algebras and probability measures. We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos.

This raises the question of whether, given a gradually typed language, the combination of the translation that injects checks in well-typed terms and the dynamic semantics that determines their behavior sufficiently enforce the static type system of the language. Neither type soundness, nor complete monitoring, nor any other meta-theoretic property of gradually typed languages to date provides a satisfying answer. In response, we present vigilance, a semantic analytical instrument that defines when the check-injecting translation and dynamic semantics of a gradually typed language are adequate for its static type system. Technically, vigilance asks if a given translation-and-semantics combination enforces the complete run-time typing history of a value, which consists of all of the types associated with the value. We show that the standard combination for so-called Natural gradual typing is vigilant for the standard simple type system, but the standard combination for Transient gradual typing is not. At the same time, the standard combination for Transient is vigilant for a tag type system but the standard combination for Natural is not. Hence, we clarify the comparative type-level reasoning power between the two most studied approaches to sound gradual typing. Furthermore, as an exercise that demonstrates how vigilance can guide design, we introduce and examine a new theoretical static gradual type system, dubbed truer, that is stronger than tag typing and more faithfully reflects the type-level reasoning power that the dynamic semantics of Transient gradual typing can guarantee."

And yet, such linking can expose a language to foreign behaviors that are internally inexpressible, which poses a serious threat to safety invariants and programmer reasoning. To preserve such invariants, a language may try to add features to limit the reliance on external libraries, but endless extensions can obscure the core abstractions the language was designed to provide. In this paper, we outline an approach that encapsulates foreign code in a sound way—i.e., without disturbing the invariants promised by types of the core language. First, one introduces novel linking types that characterize the behaviors of foreign libraries that are inexpressible in the core language. To reason about the soundness of linking, one constructs a realizability model that captures the meaning of both core types and linking types as sets of target-language terms. Using this model, one can formally prove when foreign behavior is encapsulated ; that is, unobservable to core code. We show one way to discharge such proofs automatically by augmenting the compiler to insert verified encapsulation wrappers around components that use foreign libraries. Inspired by existing approaches to FFIs, we develop a pair of case studies that extend a pure, functional language: one extension for state, and another for exceptions. The first allows us to implement mutable references via a library, whereas the second allows us to implement try and catch as library functions. Both extensions and the overall system are proven sound using logical relations that use realizability techniques."

In particular, Lilac has a frame rule identical to the ordinary one, and naturally accommodates advanced features like continuous random variables and reasoning about quantitative properties of programs.

Fuzzers are used to automatically test programs, ideally creating high-coverage input corpora and finding bugs. Modern “greybox” fuzzers evolve a corpus of inputs by applying mutations to inputs and then executing those new inputs while collecting coverage. New inputs that are “interesting” (e.g. reveal new coverage) are saved to the corpus. Given their non-deterministic nature, the impact of each design decision on the fuzzer’s performance can be difficult to predict. Some design decisions (e.g., ” Should the fuzzer perform deterministic mutations of inputs? ”) are exposed to end-users as configuration flags, but others (e.g., ” What kinds of random mutations to apply to inputs?”) are typically baked into the fuzzer code itself. This paper describes our over 12.5-CPU-year evaluation of the set of mutation operators employed by the popular AFL++ fuzzer, including the havoc phase, splicing, and, exploring the impact of adjusting some of those unexposed configurations. In this experience paper, we propose a methodology for determining different fuzzers’ behavioral diversity with respect to branch coverage and bug detection using rigorous statistical methods. Our key finding is that, across a range of targets, disabling certain mutation operators (some of which were previously “baked-in” to the fuzzer) resulted in inputs that cover different lines of code and reveal different bugs. A surprising result is disabling certain mutators leads to more diverse coverage and allows the fuzzer to find more bugs faster . We call for researchers to investigate seemingly simple design decisions in fuzzers more thoroughly and encourage fuzzer developers to expose more configuration parameters pertaining to these design decisions to end users."

Parametric fuzzers internally represent inputs as bit strings referred to as ""parameter sequences"". Interesting parameter sequences are saved by the fuzzer and perturbed to create new inputs without the need for type-specific operators. However, existing work on parametric fuzzing only uses mutation operators, which modify a single input; it does not incorporate crossover, an evolutionary operator that blends multiple inputs together. Crossover operators aim to combine advantageous traits from multiple inputs. However, the nature of parametric fuzzing limits the effectiveness of traditional crossover operators. In this paper, we propose linked crossover, an approach for using dynamic execution information to identify and exchange analogous portions of parameter sequences. We created an implementation of linked crossover for Java and evaluated linked crossover's ability to preserve advantageous traits. We also evaluated linked crossover's impact on fuzzer performance on seven real-world Java projects and found that linked crossover consistently performed as well as or better than three state-of-the-art parametric fuzzers and two other forms of crossover on both long and short fuzzing campaigns."

Most fuzzers operate by generating inputs for applications and mutating the bytes of those inputs, guiding the fuzzing process with branch coverage feedback via instrumentation. Whitebox guidance (e.g., taint tracking or concolic execution) is sometimes integrated with coverage-guided fuzzing to help cover tricky-to-reach branches that are guarded by complex conditions (so-called ""magic values""). This integration typically takes the form of a targeted input mutation, e.g. , placing particular byte values at a specific offset of some input in order to cover a branch. However, these dynamic analysis techniques are not perfect in practice, which can result in the loss of important relationships between input bytes and branch predicates, thus reducing the effective power of the technique. We introduce a new, surprisingly simple, but effective technique, global hinting , which allows the fuzzer to insert these interesting bytes not only at a targeted position, but in any position of any input. We implemented this idea in Java, creating Confetti, which uses both targeted and global hints for fuzzing. In an empirical comparison with two baseline approaches, a state-of-the-art greybox Java fuzzer and a version of Confetti without global hinting, we found that Confetti covers more branches and finds 15 previously unreported bugs, including 9 that neither baseline could find. By conducting a post-mortem analysis of Confetti's execution, we determined that global hinting was at least as effective at revealing new coverage as traditional, targeted hinting."

Some offer rich type systems to facilitate the smooth migration of untyped code to the typed world; others merely provide a convenient form of type Dynamic together with a conventional structural type system. Orthogonal to this dimension, Natural systems ensure the integrity of types with a sophisticated contract system, while Transient systems insert simple first-order checks at strategic places within typed code. Furthermore, each method of ensuring type integrity comes with its own blame-assignment strategy.Typed Racket has a rich migratory type system and enforces the types with a Natural semantics. Reticulated Python has a simple structural type system extended with Dynamic and enforces types with a Transient semantics. While Typed Racket satisfies the most stringent gradual-type soundness properties at a significant performance cost, Reticulated Python seems to limit the performance penalty to a tolerable degree and is nevertheless type sound. This comparison raises the question of whether Transient checking is applicable to and beneficial for a rich migratory type system.This paper reports on the surprising difficulties of adapting the Transient semantics of Reticulated Python to the rich migratory type system of Typed Racket. The resulting implementation, Shallow Typed Racket, is faster than the standard Deep Typed Racket but only when the Transient blame assignment strategy is disabled. For language designers, this report provides valuable hints on how to equip an existing compiler to support a Transient semantics.

To program these architectures using ordinary languages such as C, a dataflow compiler must transform the original sequential, imperative program into an equivalent dataflow graph, composed of dataflow operators running in parallel. This transformation is challenging since the asynchronous nature of dataflow graphs allows out-of-order execution of operators, leading to behaviors not present in the original imperative programs. We address this challenge by developing a translation validation technique for dataflow compilers to ensure that the dataflow program has the same behavior as the original imperative program on all possible inputs and schedules of execution. We apply this method to a state-of-the-art dataflow compiler targeting the RipTide CGRA architecture. Our tool uncovers 8 compiler bugs where the compiler outputs incorrect dataflow graphs, including a data race that is otherwise hard to discover via testing. After repairing these bugs, our tool verifies the correct compilation of all programs in the RipTide benchmark suite."

DOI: 10.1145/3485488","Gradually typed languages allow programmers to mix statically and dynamically typed code, enabling them to incrementally reap the benefits of static typing as they add type annotations to their code. However, this type migration process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper examines the problem of automated type migration: given a dynamic program, infer additional or improved type annotations. Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities. We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the migration to be compatible with unmigrated code. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ""challenge problems."" Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties of gradual type migration. In addition, we apply TypeWhich to a suite of benchmarks for Grift, a programming language based on the GTLC. TypeWhich is able to reconstruct all human-written annotations on all but one program."

We propose Iterative Dimension Informed Program Synthesis (IDIPS) to address these limitations by learning and adapting social navigation in the form of human-readable symbolic programs. IDIPS works by combining pro-gram synthesis, parameter optimization, predicate repair, and iterative human demonstration to learn and adapt model-free action selection policies. and generates policies that can be transferred from simulation to real-world robots with minimal effort."

Several representation learning algorithms for graph data, such as DeepWalk, node2vec, and Graph-SAGE, sample the graph to produce mini-batches that are suitable for training a DNN. However, sampling time can be a significant fraction of training time, and existing systems do not efficiently parallelize sampling. Sampling is an ""embarrassingly parallel"" problem and may appear to lend itself to GPU acceleration, but the irregularity of graphs makes it hard to use GPU resources effectively. This paper presents NextDoor, a system designed to effectively perform graph sampling on GPUs. NextDoor employs a new approach to graph sampling that we call transit-parallelism, which allows load balancing and caching of edges. NextDoor provides end-users with a high-level abstraction for writing a variety of graph sampling algorithms. We implement several graph sampling applications, and show that NextDoor runs them orders of magnitude faster than existing systems."

The performance of high-level languages depends not only on the underlying performance of WebAssembly, but also on the quality of the generated WebAssembly code. In this paper, we identify several features of high-level languages that current approaches can only compile to WebAssembly by generating complex and inefficient code. We argue that these problems could be addressed if WebAssembly natively supported first-class continuations. We then present Wasm/k, which extends WebAssembly with delimited continuations. Wasm/k introduces no new value types, and thus does not require significant changes to the WebAssembly type system (validation). Wasm/k is safe, even in the presence of foreign function calls (e.g., to and from JavaScript). Finally, Wasm/k is amenable to efficient implementation: we implement Wasm/k as a local change to Wasmtime, an existing WebAssembly JIT. We evaluate Wasm/k by implementing C/k, which adds delimited continuations to C/C++. C/k uses Emscripten and its implementation serves as a case study on how to use Wasm/k in a compiler that targets WebAssembly. We present several case studies using C/k, and show that on implementing green threads, it can outperform the state-of-the-art approach Asyncify with an 18% improvement in performance and a 30% improvement in code size."

Such a paradigm, while very effective, suffers from a few key problems: 1) NNs are opaque to the user and hence not amenable to verification, 2) they require significant amounts of training data, and 3) they are hard to repair when the domain changes. We present two key insights about ASPs for robotics. First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we introduce layered dimension-informed program synthesis (LDIPS) - by reasoning about the physical dimensions of state variables, and dimensional constraints on operators, LDIPS directly synthesizes ASPs in a human-interpretable domain-specific language that is amenable to program repair. We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots."

In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λ Λ , an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λ Λ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λ Λ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λ Λ coincide. Second, we augment λ Λ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λ Λ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work.

Several widely-publicized outages have been blamed not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is that configurations can be non-deterministic. This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations. Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver.

We bridge the gap between these two perspectives by showing that these two methods of decomposition are equivalent up to a suitable equivalence of categories. Our main result is a probabilistic analog of the classic equivalence between the category of nominal sets and the Schanuel topos. Through this equivalence, we validate design decisions in prior work on probabilistic separation logic and create new connections to nominal-setlike models of probability."

In this paper, we outline how we can encode design constraints into a compact circuit representation that affords generation without search. These generators yield samples that are distributed uniformly over the space of valid designs. We illustrate our approach with binary decision diagrams (BDDs) in comparison to the traditional approach with answer-set programming (ASP) in two scenarios: a grid-based tile placement scenario inspired by WaveFunctionCollapse, and a playable platformer level design scenario. These compiled design-space models make constraint-based methods easier to deploy by improving on both the running time and diversity of previous constraint-based methods."

Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis, network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis, but they prove to be challenging for existing PPLs. We develop a domain-specific probabilistic programming language called Dice that features a new approach to exact discrete probabilistic program inference. Dice exploits program structure in order to factorize inference, enabling us to perform exact inference on probabilistic programs with hundreds of thousands of random variables. Our key technical contribution is a new reduction from discrete probabilistic programs to weighted model counting (WMC). This reduction separates the structure of the distribution from its parameters, enabling logical reasoning tools to exploit that structure for probabilistic inference. We (1) show how to compositionally reduce Dice inference to WMC, (2) prove this compilation correct with respect to a denotational semantics, (3) empirically demonstrate the performance benefits over prior approaches, and (4) analyze the types of structure that allow Dice to scale to large probabilistic programs."

We demonstrate a text-based approach to using TRRBTs to create several simple games, show how the approach allows re-use of trees to build on existing games, and show how they can provide a unified representation for procedural content generation and enemy AI along with game mechanics."

The former shows promise by automating the specification of quality criteria through latent patterns in data, while the latter offers significant advantages for authorial control. In this paper we propose the use of probabilistic logic as a unifying framework that combines the benefits of both methodologies. We propose a Bayesian formalization of content generators as probability distributions and show how common PCG tasks map naturally to operations on the distribution. Further, through a series of experiments with maze generation, we demonstrate how probabilistic logic semantics allows us to leverage the authorial control of declarative programming and the flexibility of learning from data."

And yet, such linking can expose a language to foreign behaviors that are internally inexpressible, which poses a serious threat to safety invariants and programmer reasoning. To preserve such invariants, a language may try to add features to limit the reliance on external libraries, but endless extensions can obscure the core abstractions the language was designed to provide. In this paper, we outline an approach that encapsulates foreign code in a sound way—i.e., without disturbing the invariants promised by types of the core language. First, one introduces novel linking types that characterize the behaviors of foreign libraries that are inexpressible in the core language. To reason about the soundness of linking, one constructs a realizability model that captures the meaning of both core types and linking types as sets of target-language terms. Using this model, one can formally prove when foreign behavior is encapsulated ; that is, unobservable to core code. We show one way to discharge such proofs automatically by augmenting the compiler to insert verified encapsulation wrappers around components that use foreign libraries. Inspired by existing approaches to FFIs, we develop a pair of case studies that extend a pure, functional language: one extension for state, and another for exceptions. The first allows us to implement mutable references via a library, whereas the second allows us to implement try and catch as library functions. Both extensions and the overall system are proven sound using logical relations that use realizability techniques."

Founding the field, John McCarthy and James Painter set out to build a ""completely trustworthy compiler"". And yet, until quite recently, even despite truly impressive verification efforts, the theorems being proved were only about the compilation of whole programs, a theoretically quite appealing but practically unrealistic simplification. For a compiler correctness theorem to assure complete trust, the theorem must reflect the reality of how the compiler will be used. There has been much recent work on more realistic ""compositional"" compiler correctness aimed at proving correct compilation of components while supporting linking with components compiled from different languages using different compilers. However, the variety of theorems, stated in remarkably different ways, raises questions about what researchers even mean by a ""compiler is correct."" In this pearl, we develop a new framework with which to understand compiler correctness theorems in the presence of linking, and apply it to understanding and comparing this diversity of results. In doing so, not only are we better able to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses, but gain insight into what we as a community should expect from compiler correctness theorems of the future."

It reflects our belief that the core task of an optimising compiler for a functional language is to reason about the environment structure of the program. Our IR is distinguished by the presence of extent annotations, added to all variables (and verified by static analysis). These annotations are defined in terms of the semantics of the IR, but they directly tell the compiler what machine resources are needed to implement the environment structure of each annotated variable."

This approach, popularized by MLton, has limitations, however. We are interested in exploring a different approach to compiling such languages, one that preserves the higher-order and polymorphic character of the program throughout optimization. To enable such an approach, we must have effective analyses that both provide precise information about higher-order programs and that scale to larger units of compilation. This paper describes one such analysis for determining the extent of variable bindings. We classify the extent of variables as either register (only one binding instance can be live at any time), stack (the lifetimes of binding instances obey a LIFO order), or heap (binding lifetimes are arbitrary). These extents naturally connect variables to the machine resources required to represent them. We believe that precise information about binding extents will enable efficient management of environments, which is a key problem in the efficient compilation of higher-order programs. At the core of the paper is the 3CPS intermediate representation, which is a factored CPS-based intermediate representation (IR) that statically marks variables to indicate their binding extent. We formally specify the management of this binding structure by means of a small-step operational semantics and define a static analysis that determines the extents of the variables in a program. We evaluate our analysis using a standard suite of SML benchmark programs. Our implementation gets surprisingly high yield and exhibits scalable performance. While this paper uses a CPS-based IR, the algorithm and results are easily transferable to other λ-calculus IRs, such as ANF."

Code coverage has been the most popular metric to assess test suite quality. However, traditional code coverage criteria do not adequately reflect completion, interactions, and error handling of asynchronous operations. This paper proposes novel test adequacy criteria for measuring: (i) completion of asynchronous operations in terms of both successful and exceptional execution, (ii) registration of reactions for handling both possible outcomes, and (iii) execution of said reactions through tests. We implement JScope, a tool for automatically measuring coverage according to these criteria in JavaScript applications, as an interactive plug-in for Visual Studio Code. An evaluation of JScope on 20 JavaScript applications shows that the proposed criteria can help improve assessment of test adequacy, complementing traditional criteria. According to our investigation of 15 real GitHub issues concerned with asynchrony, the new criteria can help reveal faulty asynchronous behaviors that are untested yet are deemed covered by traditional coverage criteria. We also report on a controlled experiment with 12 participants to investigate the usefulness of JScope in realistic settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving programmers’ ability to assess test adequacy and detect untested behavior of asynchronous code."

Unfortunately, migrating existing projects to take advantage of this feature is nontrivial, as the code changes required to introduce asynchrony may involve complex, non-local transformations. Our approach relies on static analysis to identify external packages that can be loaded lazily and generates the code transformations required to lazily load those packages.

Call graphs are at the core of many interprocedural static analysis and optimization techniques. However, WebAssembly poses some unique challenges for static call graph construction. Currently, these challenges are neither well understood, nor is it clear to what extent existing techniques address them. This paper presents the first systematic study of WebAssembly-specific challenges for static call graph construction and of the state-of-the-art in call graph analysis. We identify and classify 12 challenges, encode them into a suite of 24 executable microbenchmarks, and measure their prevalence in real-world binaries. These challenges reflect idiosyncrasies of WebAssembly, such as indirect calls via a mutable function table, interactions with the host environment, and unmanaged linear memory. We show that they commonly occur across a set of more than 8,000 real-world binaries. Based on our microbenchmarks and a set of executable real-world binaries, we then study the soundness and precision of four existing static analyses. Our findings include that, surprisingly, all of the existing techniques are unsound, without this being documented anywhere. We envision our work to provide guidance for improving static call graph construction for WebAssembly. In particular, the presented microbenchmarks will enable future work to check whether an analysis supports challenging language features, and to quantify its soundness and precision."

In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit.

Trajectory-Aware Eligibility Traces for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning ICML, 6818-6835. https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/daley23a.html","Off-policy learning from multistep returns is crucial for sample-efficient reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing protocols for cutting the IS ratios (traces) to combat the variance of the IS estimator. Unfortunately, once a trace has been cut, the effect cannot be easily reversed. This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that unifies per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory awareness to perform robustly across λ λ -values in an off-policy control task."

Many such methods take the form of actor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access to the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being available at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis. In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance, contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are related to the effectiveness of different types of critics."

Decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have difficulty learning decentralized policies because of the environment appearing to be non-stationary due to other agents also learning at the same time. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a macro-action-based decentralized multi-agent double deep recurrent Q-net (MacDec-MADDRQN) which trains each decentralized Q-net using a centralized Q-net for action selection. A generalized version of MacDec-MADDRQN with two separate training environments, called Parallel-MacDec-MADDRQN, is also presented to leverage either centralized or decentralized exploration.

Further, we call for future work on the portability of designs across different types of printers which could enable broader participation in future maker efforts at this scale."

However, it is not clear whether the advantages of regions (e.g. better localization) are the key reasons for the success of bottom-up attention. In this paper, we revisit grid features for VQA, and find they can work surprisingly well -- running more than an order of magnitude faster with the same accuracy (e.g. if pre-trained in a similar fashion). Through extensive experiments, we verify that this observation holds true across different VQA models (reporting a state-of-the-art accuracy on VQA 2.0 test-std, 72.71), datasets, and generalizes well to other tasks like image captioning. As grid features make the model design and training process much simpler, this enables us to train them end-to-end and also use a more flexible network design. We learn VQA models end-to-end, from pixels directly to answers, and show that strong performance is achievable without using any region annotations in pre-training. We hope our findings help further improve the scientific understanding and the practical application of VQA. Code and features will be made available."

We assume that a large number of unlabeled videos from this domain are readily available. We automatically obtain labels on the target data by using high-confidence detections from the existing detector, augmented with hard (misclassified) examples acquired by exploiting temporal cues using a tracker. These automatically-obtained labels are then used for re-training the original model. A modified knowledge distillation loss is proposed, and we investigate several ways of assigning soft-labels to the training examples from the target domain. Our approach is empirically evaluated on challenging face and pedestrian detection tasks: a face detector trained on WIDER-Face, which consists of high-quality images crawled from the web, is adapted to a large-scale surveillance data set; a pedestrian detector trained on clear, daytime images from the BDD-100K driving data set is adapted to all other scenarios such as rainy, foggy, night-time. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of incorporating hard examples obtained from tracking, the advantage of using soft-labels via distillation loss versus hard-labels, and show promising performance as a simple method for unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors, with minimal dependence on hyper-parameters."

Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for understanding physical systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries of data using relaxed group convolutions. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that this flexible convolution technique allows the model to maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in various physical systems. We employ various relaxed group convolution architectures to uncover various symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically meaningful in different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the time-reversal symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.

Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data. We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.

We introduce Energy Score, a proper scoring rule, to evaluate probabilistic predictions. We propose a novel deep dynamics model, Probabilistic Equivariant Continuous COnvolution (PECCO) for probabilistic prediction of multi-agent trajectories.

This network can be trained end-to-end with an equivariant task network to learn an explicitly symmetric representation. We validate this approach in the context of equivariant transition models with 3 distinct forms of symmetry.

In particular, solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) over manifolds depend critically on the underlying geometry. While graph neural networks have been successfully applied to PDEs, they do not incorporate surface geometry and do not consider local gauge symmetries of the manifold. Alternatively, recent works on gauge equivariant convolutional and attentional architectures on meshes leverage the underlying geometry but underperform in modeling surface PDEs with complex nonlinear dynamics. To address these issues, we introduce a new gauge equivariant architecture using nonlinear message passing. Our novel architecture achieves higher performance than either convolutional or attentional networks on domains with highly complex and nonlinear dynamics.

To achieve this, we propose to (i) decompose the multi-modal dynamics into elemental movement primitives, (ii) parameterize each primitive using a recurrent graph neural network to capture interactions, and (iii) integrate a high-level planner that composes primitives sequentially and a low-level controller to combine primitive dynamics and inverse kinematics control. Our model is a deep, hierarchical, modular architecture. Compared to baselines, our model generalizes better and achieves higher success rates on several simulated bimanual robotic manipulation tasks. We open source the code for simulation, data, and models at: https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/HDR-IL."

Fuzzers are used to automatically test programs, ideally creating high-coverage input corpora and finding bugs. Modern “greybox” fuzzers evolve a corpus of inputs by applying mutations to inputs and then executing those new inputs while collecting coverage. New inputs that are “interesting” (e.g. reveal new coverage) are saved to the corpus. Given their non-deterministic nature, the impact of each design decision on the fuzzer’s performance can be difficult to predict. Some design decisions (e.g., ” Should the fuzzer perform deterministic mutations of inputs? ”) are exposed to end-users as configuration flags, but others (e.g., ” What kinds of random mutations to apply to inputs?”) are typically baked into the fuzzer code itself. This paper describes our over 12.5-CPU-year evaluation of the set of mutation operators employed by the popular AFL++ fuzzer, including the havoc phase, splicing, and, exploring the impact of adjusting some of those unexposed configurations. In this experience paper, we propose a methodology for determining different fuzzers’ behavioral diversity with respect to branch coverage and bug detection using rigorous statistical methods. Our key finding is that, across a range of targets, disabling certain mutation operators (some of which were previously “baked-in” to the fuzzer) resulted in inputs that cover different lines of code and reveal different bugs. A surprising result is disabling certain mutators leads to more diverse coverage and allows the fuzzer to find more bugs faster . We call for researchers to investigate seemingly simple design decisions in fuzzers more thoroughly and encourage fuzzer developers to expose more configuration parameters pertaining to these design decisions to end users."

Parametric fuzzers internally represent inputs as bit strings referred to as ""parameter sequences"". Interesting parameter sequences are saved by the fuzzer and perturbed to create new inputs without the need for type-specific operators. However, existing work on parametric fuzzing only uses mutation operators, which modify a single input; it does not incorporate crossover, an evolutionary operator that blends multiple inputs together. Crossover operators aim to combine advantageous traits from multiple inputs. However, the nature of parametric fuzzing limits the effectiveness of traditional crossover operators. In this paper, we propose linked crossover, an approach for using dynamic execution information to identify and exchange analogous portions of parameter sequences. We created an implementation of linked crossover for Java and evaluated linked crossover's ability to preserve advantageous traits. We also evaluated linked crossover's impact on fuzzer performance on seven real-world Java projects and found that linked crossover consistently performed as well as or better than three state-of-the-art parametric fuzzers and two other forms of crossover on both long and short fuzzing campaigns."

However, to date little evidence has been provided that artifacts which have passed AE actually live up to these high expectations, i.e., to which degree AE processes contribute to AE's goals and whether the overhead they impose is justified. We aim to fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of research artifacts from a decade of software engineering (SE) and programming languages (PL) conferences, based on which we reflect on the goals and mechanisms of AE in our community.

Most fuzzers operate by generating inputs for applications and mutating the bytes of those inputs, guiding the fuzzing process with branch coverage feedback via instrumentation. Whitebox guidance (e.g., taint tracking or concolic execution) is sometimes integrated with coverage-guided fuzzing to help cover tricky-to-reach branches that are guarded by complex conditions (so-called ""magic values""). This integration typically takes the form of a targeted input mutation, e.g. , placing particular byte values at a specific offset of some input in order to cover a branch. However, these dynamic analysis techniques are not perfect in practice, which can result in the loss of important relationships between input bytes and branch predicates, thus reducing the effective power of the technique. We introduce a new, surprisingly simple, but effective technique, global hinting , which allows the fuzzer to insert these interesting bytes not only at a targeted position, but in any position of any input. We implemented this idea in Java, creating Confetti, which uses both targeted and global hints for fuzzing. In an empirical comparison with two baseline approaches, a state-of-the-art greybox Java fuzzer and a version of Confetti without global hinting, we found that Confetti covers more branches and finds 15 previously unreported bugs, including 9 that neither baseline could find. By conducting a post-mortem analysis of Confetti's execution, we determined that global hinting was at least as effective at revealing new coverage as traditional, targeted hinting."

DOI: 10.1145/3485488","Gradually typed languages allow programmers to mix statically and dynamically typed code, enabling them to incrementally reap the benefits of static typing as they add type annotations to their code. However, this type migration process is typically a manual effort with limited tool support. This paper examines the problem of automated type migration: given a dynamic program, infer additional or improved type annotations. Existing type migration algorithms prioritize different goals, such as maximizing type precision, maintaining compatibility with unmigrated code, and preserving the semantics of the original program. We argue that the type migration problem involves fundamental compromises: optimizing for a single goal often comes at the expense of others. Ideally, a type migration tool would flexibly accommodate a range of user priorities. We present TypeWhich, a new approach to automated type migration for the gradually-typed lambda calculus with some extensions. Unlike prior work, which relies on custom solvers, TypeWhich produces constraints for an off-the-shelf MaxSMT solver. This allows us to easily express objectives, such as minimizing the number of necessary syntactic coercions, and constraining the type of the migration to be compatible with unmigrated code. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of GTLC type migration algorithms, and compare TypeWhich to four other tools from the literature. Our evaluation uses prior benchmarks, and a new set of ""challenge problems."" Moreover, we design a new evaluation methodology that highlights the subtleties of gradual type migration. In addition, we apply TypeWhich to a suite of benchmarks for Grift, a programming language based on the GTLC. TypeWhich is able to reconstruct all human-written annotations on all but one program."

The performance of high-level languages depends not only on the underlying performance of WebAssembly, but also on the quality of the generated WebAssembly code. In this paper, we identify several features of high-level languages that current approaches can only compile to WebAssembly by generating complex and inefficient code. We argue that these problems could be addressed if WebAssembly natively supported first-class continuations. We then present Wasm/k, which extends WebAssembly with delimited continuations. Wasm/k introduces no new value types, and thus does not require significant changes to the WebAssembly type system (validation). Wasm/k is safe, even in the presence of foreign function calls (e.g., to and from JavaScript). Finally, Wasm/k is amenable to efficient implementation: we implement Wasm/k as a local change to Wasmtime, an existing WebAssembly JIT. We evaluate Wasm/k by implementing C/k, which adds delimited continuations to C/C++. C/k uses Emscripten and its implementation serves as a case study on how to use Wasm/k in a compiler that targets WebAssembly. We present several case studies using C/k, and show that on implementing green threads, it can outperform the state-of-the-art approach Asyncify with an 18% improvement in performance and a 30% improvement in code size."

Such a paradigm, while very effective, suffers from a few key problems: 1) NNs are opaque to the user and hence not amenable to verification, 2) they require significant amounts of training data, and 3) they are hard to repair when the domain changes. We present two key insights about ASPs for robotics. First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we introduce layered dimension-informed program synthesis (LDIPS) - by reasoning about the physical dimensions of state variables, and dimensional constraints on operators, LDIPS directly synthesizes ASPs in a human-interpretable domain-specific language that is amenable to program repair. We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots."

In serverless computing, programmers write what are called serverless functions, and the cloud platform transparently manages the operating system, resource allocation, load-balancing, and fault tolerance. When demand for the service spikes, the platform automatically allocates additional hardware to the service and manages load-balancing; when demand falls, the platform silently deallocates idle resources; and when the platform detects a failure, it transparently retries affected requests. In 2014, Amazon Web Services introduced the first serverless platform, AWS Lambda, and similar abstractions are now available on all major cloud computing platforms. Unfortunately, the serverless computing abstraction exposes several low-level operational details that make it hard for programmers to write and reason about their code. This paper sheds light on this problem by presenting λ Λ , an operational semantics of the essence of serverless computing. Despite being a small (half a page) core calculus, λ Λ models all the low-level details that serverless functions can observe. To show that λ Λ is useful, we present three applications. First, to ease reasoning about code, we present a simplified naive semantics of serverless execution and precisely characterize when the naive semantics and λ Λ coincide. Second, we augment λ Λ with a key-value store to allow reasoning about stateful serverless functions. Third, since a handful of serverless platforms support serverless function composition, we show how to extend λ Λ with a composition language. We have implemented this composition language and show that it outperforms prior work. The latest version of this paper, corrects an error in Definition 4.2 and thus the proof of Theorem 4.3, which were found in the published version. PDF available on arXiv"

Several widely-publicized outages have been blamed not on software bugs, but on configuration bugs. To cope, thousands of organizations use system configuration languages to manage their computing infrastructure. Of these, Puppet is the most widely used with thousands of paying customers and many more open-source users. The heart of Puppet is a domain-specific language that describes the state of a system. Puppet already performs some basic static checks, but they only prevent a narrow range of errors. Furthermore, testing is ineffective because many errors are only triggered under specific machine states that are difficult to predict and reproduce. With several examples, we show that a key problem with Puppet is that configurations can be non-deterministic. This paper presents Rehearsal, a verification tool for Puppet configurations. Rehearsal implements a sound, complete, and scalable determinacy analysis for Puppet. To develop it, we (1) present a formal semantics for Puppet, (2) use several analyses to shrink our models to a tractable size, and (3) frame determinism-checking as decidable formulas for an SMT solver. Rehearsal then leverages the determinacy analysis to check other important properties, such as idempotency. Finally, we apply Rehearsal to several real-world Puppet configurations.

The neural MCTS algorithm has been successful in finding near-optimal strategies for games through self-play. However, the AlphaZero algorithm has a significant drawback; it takes a long time to converge and requires high computational power due to complex neural networks for solving games like Chess, Go, Shogi, etc. Owing to this, it is very difficult to pursue neural MCTS research without cutting-edge hardware, which is a roadblock for many aspiring neural MCTS researchers. In this paper, we propose a new neural MCTS algorithm, called Dual MCTS, which helps overcome these drawbacks. Dual MCTS uses two different search trees, a single deep neural network, and a new update technique for the search trees using a combination of the PUCB, a sliding-window, and the epsilon-greedy algorithm. This technique is applicable to any MCTS based algorithm to reduce the number of updates to the tree. We show that Dual MCTS performs better than one of the most widely used neural MCTS algorithms, AlphaZero, for various symmetric and asymmetric games."

In this paper, we try to leverage the computational power of neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (neural MCTS), the core algorithm from AlphaZero, to solve Quantified Boolean Formula Satisfaction (QSAT) problems, which are PSPACE complete. Knowing that every QSAT problem is equivalent to a QSAT game, the game outcome can be used to derive the solutions of the original QSAT problems. We propose a way to encode Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs) as graphs and apply a graph neural network (GNN) to embed the QBFs into the neural MCTS. After training, an off-the-shelf QSAT solver is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Our result shows that, for problems within a limited size, the algorithm learns to solve the problem correctly merely from self-play."

Therefore, learning to play a semantic game perfectly leads to the solution of a specific instance of a combinatorial problem. We adapt the AlphaZero algorithm so that it becomes better at learning to play semantic games that have different characteristics than Go and Chess. We propose a general framework, Persephone, to map the FOL description of a combinatorial problem to a semantic game so that it can be solved through a neural MCTS based reinforcement learning algorithm.

This approach, popularized by MLton, has limitations, however. We are interested in exploring a different approach to compiling such languages, one that preserves the higher-order and polymorphic character of the program throughout optimization. To enable such an approach, we must have effective analyses that both provide precise information about higher-order programs and that scale to larger units of compilation. This paper describes one such analysis for determining the extent of variable bindings. We classify the extent of variables as either register (only one binding instance can be live at any time), stack (the lifetimes of binding instances obey a LIFO order), or heap (binding lifetimes are arbitrary). These extents naturally connect variables to the machine resources required to represent them. We believe that precise information about binding extents will enable efficient management of environments, which is a key problem in the efficient compilation of higher-order programs. At the core of the paper is the 3CPS intermediate representation, which is a factored CPS-based intermediate representation (IR) that statically marks variables to indicate their binding extent. We formally specify the management of this binding structure by means of a small-step operational semantics and define a static analysis that determines the extents of the variables in a program. We evaluate our analysis using a standard suite of SML benchmark programs. Our implementation gets surprisingly high yield and exhibits scalable performance. While this paper uses a CPS-based IR, the algorithm and results are easily transferable to other λ-calculus IRs, such as ANF."

Code coverage has been the most popular metric to assess test suite quality.

This paper proposes novel test adequacy criteria for measuring: (i) completion of asynchronous operations in terms of both successful and exceptional execution, (ii) registration of reactions for handling both possible outcomes, and (iii) execution of said reactions through tests. We implement JScope, a tool for automatically measuring coverage according to these criteria in JavaScript applications, as an interactive plug-in for Visual Studio Code. An evaluation of JScope on 20 JavaScript applications shows that the proposed criteria can help improve assessment of test adequacy, complementing traditional criteria. According to our investigation of 15 real GitHub issues concerned with asynchrony, the new criteria can help reveal faulty asynchronous behaviors that are untested yet are deemed covered by traditional coverage criteria. We also report on a controlled experiment with 12 participants to investigate the usefulness of JScope in realistic settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving programmers’ ability to assess test adequacy and detect untested behavior of asynchronous code."

Call graphs are at the core of many interprocedural static analysis and optimization techniques. However, WebAssembly poses some unique challenges for static call graph construction. Currently, these challenges are neither well understood, nor is it clear to what extent existing techniques address them. This paper presents the first systematic study of WebAssembly-specific challenges for static call graph construction and of the state-of-the-art in call graph analysis. We identify and classify 12 challenges, encode them into a suite of 24 executable microbenchmarks, and measure their prevalence in real-world binaries. These challenges reflect idiosyncrasies of WebAssembly, such as indirect calls via a mutable function table, interactions with the host environment, and unmanaged linear memory. We show that they commonly occur across a set of more than 8,000 real-world binaries. Based on our microbenchmarks and a set of executable real-world binaries, we then study the soundness and precision of four existing static analyses. Our findings include that, surprisingly, all of the existing techniques are unsound, without this being documented anywhere. We envision our work to provide guidance for improving static call graph construction for WebAssembly. In particular, the presented microbenchmarks will enable future work to check whether an analysis supports challenging language features, and to quantify its soundness and precision."

We show that Julia's subtyping is undecidable, and we propose a restriction on types to recover decidability by stratifying types into method signatures over value types---where the former can freely use bounded existential types but the latter are restricted to use-site variance. A corpus analysis suggests that nearly all Julia programs written in practice already conform to this restriction."

Fuzzing is an approach for automatically exercising code, and could be used to obtain more runnable code. However, the shape of user-defined data in dynamic languages is difficult to intuit, limiting a fuzzer's reach. We propose a feedback-driven blackbox fuzzing approach which draws inputs from a database of values recorded from existing code.

We have carried out an evaluation on 1,545 packages comprising 1.7M lines of R code.

When it comes to maintaining and evolving these systems, the lack of explicit static typing becomes a bottleneck. In response, researchers have explored the idea of gradually-typed programming languages which allow the incremental addition of type annotations to software written in one of these untyped languages. Some of these new, hybrid languages insert run-time checks at the boundary between typed and untyped code to establish type soundness for the overall system. With sound gradual typing, programmers can rely on the language implementation to provide meaningful error messages when type invariants are violated. While most research on sound gradual typing remains theoretical, the few emerging implementations suffer from performance overheads due to these checks. None of the publications on this topic comes with a comprehensive performance evaluation. Worse, a few report disastrous numbers. In response, this paper proposes a method for evaluating the performance of gradually-typed programming languages. The method hinges on exploring the space of partial conversions from untyped to typed. For each benchmark, the performance of the different versions is reported in a synthetic metric that associates runtime overhead to conversion effort. The paper reports on the results of applying the method to Typed Racket, a mature implementation of sound gradual typing, using a suite of real-world programs of various sizes and complexities. Based on these results the paper concludes that, given the current state of implementation technologies, sound gradual typing faces significant challenges. Conversely, it raises the question of how implementations could reduce the overheads associated with soundness and how tools could be used to steer programmers clear from pathological cases."

Today's remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies offer opportunities to objectively monitor patients' activities, but they were not specifically designed for youth concussion patients; moreover, the large amount of data collected by RPM technologies may also impose significant workloads on clinicians to keep up with and use the data. To address these gaps, we employed a three-stage study consisting of a formative study, interface design, and design evaluation. We first conducted a formative study through semi-structured interviews with six highly professional concussion clinicians and identified clinicians' key challenges in remotely collecting patient information and accessing patient treatment compliance. Subsequently, we proposed preliminary clinician-facing interface designs with the integration of AI-based RPM technologies (AI-RPM), followed by design evaluation sessions with highly professional concussion clinicians. Clinicians underscored the value of integrating multi-modal AI-RPM technologies to support clinicians' decision-making while emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces with explainability and multiple responsible design considerations."

Abstract Interactive story reading is common in early childhood education, where teachers expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While many story reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights. Through this iterative process, we also synthesize and discuss a list of design implications for the design of future AI-augmented visualization systems to better assist experts' sensemaking processes in multi-modal health sensing data."

Early sepsis onset prediction and diagnosis could significantly improve the survival of sepsis patients. Existing predictive models are usually trained on high-quality data with few missing information, while missing values widely exist in real-world clinical scenarios (especially in the first hours of admissions to the hospital), which causes a significant decrease in accuracy and an increase in uncertainty for the predictive models. The common method to handle missing values is imputation, which replaces the unavailable variables with estimates from the observed data. The uncertainty of imputation results can be propagated to the sepsis prediction outputs, which have not been studied in existing works on either sepsis prediction or uncertainty quantification. In this study, we first define such propagated uncertainty as the variance of prediction output and then introduce uncertainty propagation methods to quantify the propagated uncertainty. Moreover, for the potential high-risk patients with low confidence due to limited observations, we propose a robust active sensing algorithm to increase confidence by actively recommending clinicians to observe the most informative variables. We validate the proposed models in both publicly available data (i.e., MIMIC-III and AmsterdamUMCdb) and proprietary data in The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC). The experimental results show that the propagated uncertainty is dominant at the beginning of admissions to hospitals and the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active sensing methods. Finally, we implement a SepsisLab system for early sepsis prediction and active sensing based on our pre-trained models. Clinicians and potential sepsis patients can benefit from the system in early prediction and diagnosis of sepsis."

Our findings highlight the difficulties of diagnosing cardiotoxicity (absence of unified protocols and high variability in symptoms) and monitoring patient symptoms (lacking accurate and timely patient self-reported symptoms). The clinicians also expressed their need for effective early detection tools that can integrate remote patient monitoring capabilities.

However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication."

This work focuses on the decision making of sepsis, an acute life-threatening systematic infection that requires an early diagnosis with high uncertainty from the clinician. Our aim is to explore the design requirements for AI systems that can support clinical experts in making better decisions for the early diagnosis of sepsis. The study begins with a formative study investigating why clinical experts abandon an existing AI-powered Sepsis predictive module in their electrical health record (EHR) system. We argue that a human-centered AI system needs to support human experts in the intermediate stages of a medical decision-making process (e.g., generating hypotheses or gathering data), instead of focusing only on the final decision. Therefore, we build SepsisLab based on a state-of-the-art AI algorithm and extend it to predict the future projection of sepsis development, visualize the prediction uncertainty, and propose actionable suggestions (i.e., which additional laboratory tests can be collected) to reduce such uncertainty. Through heuristic evaluation with six clinicians using our prototype system, we demonstrate that SepsisLab enables a promising human-AI collaboration paradigm for the future of AI-assisted sepsis diagnosis and other high-stakes medical decision making."

While nearly all modern networking devices and operating systems support IPv6, it remains unclear how this basic support translates into higher-layer functionality, privacy, and security in consumer IoT devices. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of IPv6 usage in smart homes in a testbed equipped with 93 distinct, popular consumer IoT devices. We investigate whether and how they support and use IPv6, focusing on factors such as IPv6 addressing, configuration, DNS and destinations, and privacy and security practices. We find that, despite most devices having some degree of IPv6 support, in an IPv6-only network just 20.4% transmit data to Internet IPv6 destinations, and only 8.6% remain functional, indicating that consumer IoT devices are not yet ready for IPv6 networks. Furthermore, 16.1% of devices use easily traceable IPv6 addresses, posing privacy risks. Our findings highlight the inadequate IPv6 support in consumer IoT devices compared to conventional devices such as laptops and mobile phones. This gap is concerning, as it may lead to not only usability issues but also privacy and security risks for smart home users."

Our results show that Amazon and third parties, including advertising and tracking services that are unique to the smart speaker ecosystem, collect smart speaker interaction data. We also find that Amazon processes smart speaker interaction data to infer user interests and uses those inferences to serve targeted ads to users. Smart speaker interaction also leads to ad targeting and as much as 30X higher bids in ad auctions, from third party advertisers.

Our analysis reveals vulnerable devices, insecure use of network protocols, and sensitive data exposure by IoT devices. We provide evidence of how this information is exfiltrated to remote servers by mobile apps and third-party SDKs, potentially for household fingerprinting, surveillance and cross-device tracking.

Understanding device behavior is important not only for determining whether devices are functioning as expected, but also can reveal implications for privacy (e.g., surreptitious audio/video recording), security (e.g., device compromise), and safety (e.g., denial of service on a baby monitor). While there has been some work on identifying devices and a handful of activities, an open question is what is the extent to which we can automatically model the entire behavior of an IoT deployment, and how it changes over time, without any privileged access to IoT devices or platform messages. In this work, we demonstrate that the vast majority of IoT behavior can indeed be modeled, using a novel multi-dimensional approach that relies only on the (often encrypted) network traffic exchanged by IoT devices. Our key insight is that IoT behavior (including cross-device interactions) can often be captured using relatively simple models such as timers (for periodic behavior) and probabilistic state-machines (for user-initiated behavior and devices interactions) during a limited observation phase. We then propose deviation metrics that can identify when the behavior of an IoT device or an IoT system changes over time. Our models and metrics successfully identify several notable changes in our IoT deployment, including a camera that changed locations, network outages that impact connectivity, and device malfunctions."

To this end, we gather more than two years of TLS network traffic from IoT devices, conduct active probing to test for vulnerabilities, and develop a novel blackbox technique for exploring the trusted root stores in IoT devices by exploiting a side-channel through TLS Alert Messages. We find a wide range of behaviors across devices, with some adopting best security practices but most being vulnerable in one or more of the following ways: use of old/insecure protocol versions and/or ciphersuites, lack of certificate validation, and poor maintenance of root stores. Specifically, we find that at least 8 IoT devices still include distrusted certificates in their root stores, 11/32 devices are vulnerable to TLS interception attacks, and that many devices fail to adopt modern protocol features over time.

Checkpointing is an important component in any strategy for software resilience and for long-running jobs that must be executed by chaining together time-bounded resource allocations. This work solves an old problem: a practical and general algorithm for transparent checkpointing of MPI that is both efficient and compatible with most of the latest network software. Transparent checkpointing is attractive due to its generality and ease of use for most MPI application developers. Earlier efforts at transparent checkpointing for MPI, one decade ago, had two difficult problems: (i) by relying on a specific MPI implementation tied to a specific network technology; and (ii) by failing to demonstrate sufficiently low runtime overhead.Problem (i) (network dependence) was already solved in 2019 by MANA's introduction of split processes. Problem (ii) (efficient runtime overhead) is solved in this work. This paper introduces an approach that avoids these limitations, employing a novel topological sort to algorithmically determine a safe future synchronization point. The algorithm is valid for both blocking and non-blocking collective communication in MPI. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach through both micro-benchmarks and a set of five real-world MPI applications, notably including the widely used VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package), which is responsible for 11% of the workload on the Perlmutter supercomputer at Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory. VASP was previously cited as a special challenge for checkpointing, in part due to its multi-algorithm codes."

The problem is made more difficult when supporting collective operations across processes, such as barrier, reduce operations, scatter and gather, etc. Some processes may have reached the barrier or other collective operation, while other processes wait a long time to reach that same barrier or collective operation. At least two solutions are well-known in the literature: (I) draining in-flight network messages and then freezing the network at checkpoint time; and (ii) adding a barrier prior to the collective operation, and either completing the operation or aborting the barrier if not all processes are present. Both solutions suffer important drawbacks. The code in the first solution must be updated whenever one ports to a newer network. The second solution implies additional barrier-related network traffic prior to each collective operation. This work presents a third solution that avoids both drawbacks. There is no additional barrier-related traffic, and the solution is implemented entirely above the network layer. The work is demonstrated in the context of transparent checkpointing of MPI libraries for parallel computation, where each of the first two solutions have already been used in prior systems, and then abandoned due to the aforementioned drawbacks. Experiments demonstrate the low runtime overhead of this new, network-agnostic approach.

While the totality of SG data represents a tremendous contribution to genomics and structural biology, reliable functional information for these proteins is generally lacking. Better functional predictions for SG proteins will add substantial value to the structural information already obtained. Our method described herein, Graph Representation of Active Sites for Prediction of Function (GRASP-Func), predicts quickly and accurately the biochemical function of proteins by representing residues at the predicted local active site as graphs rather than in Cartesian coordinates. We compare the GRASP-Func method to our previously reported method, Structurally Aligned Local Sites of Activity (SALSA), using the Ribulose Phosphate Binding Barrel (RPBB), 6-Hairpin Glycosidase (6-HG), and Concanavalin A-like Lectins/Glucanase (CAL/G) superfamilies as test cases. In each of the superfamilies, SALSA and the much faster method GRASP-Func yield similar correct classification of previously characterized proteins, providing a validated benchmark for the new method. In addition, we analyzed SG proteins using our SALSA and GRASP-Func methods to predict function. Forty-one SG proteins in the RPBB superfamily, nine SG proteins in the 6-HG superfamily, and one SG protein in the CAL/G superfamily were successfully classified into one of the functional families in their respective superfamily by both methods. This improved, faster, validated computational method can yield more reliable predictions of function that can be used for a wide variety of applications by the community.

Was this another case of an idea quickly fading from future to past tense, relegating work in this area to the graveyard of failed technologies? The recently introduced Compute Express Link (CXL) may offer a path forward, with its persistent memory profile offering a universal PMem attachment point. Yet new technologies for memory-speed persistence seem years off, and may never become competitive with evolving DRAM and flash speeds. Without persistent memory itself, is future PMem research doomed? We offer two arguments for why reports of the death of PMem research are greatly exaggerated. First, the bulk of persistent-memory research has not in fact addressed memory persistence, but rather in-memory crash consistency, which was never an issue in prior systems where CPUs could not observe post-crash memory states. CXL memory pooling allows multiple hosts to share a single memory, all in different failure domains, raising crash-consistency issues even with volatile memory. Second, we believe CXL necessitates a ""disaggregation"" of PMem research. Most work to date assumed a single technology and set of features, i.e. , speed, byte addressability, and CPU load/store access. With an open interface allowing new topologies and diverse PMem technologies, we argue for the need to examine these features individually and in combination. While one form of PMem may have been canceled, we argue that the research problems it raised not only remain relevant but have expanded in a CXL-based future."

We design an experiment infrastructure powered by a novel grammar-based differential fuzzer, test 10 popular server/proxy/CDN technologies in combinations, identify pairs that result in processing discrepancies, and discover exploits that lead to HRS.

Meanwhile, Algorithmic Complexity (AC)vulnerabilities, which are a common attack vector for denial-of-service attacks, remain an understudied threat. In this paper, we present HotFuzz, a framework for automatically discovering AC vulnerabilities in Java libraries. HotFuzz uses micro-fuzzing, a genetic algorithm that evolves arbitrary Java objects in order to trigger the worst-case performance for a method under test. We define Small Recursive Instantiation (SRI) as a technique to derive seed inputs represented as Java objects to micro-fuzzing. After micro-fuzzing, HotFuzz synthesizes test cases that triggered AC vulnerabilities into Java programs and monitors their execution in order to reproduce vulnerabilities outside the fuzzing framework. HotFuzz outputs those programs that exhibit high CPU utilization as witnesses for AC vulnerabilities in a Java library. We evaluate HotFuzz over the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the 100 most popular Java libraries on Maven, and challenges contained in the DARPA Space and Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program. We evaluate SRI's effectiveness by comparing the performance of micro-fuzzing with SRI, measured by the number of AC vulnerabilities detected, to simply using empty values as seed inputs. In this evaluation, we verified known AC vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown AC vulnerabilities that we responsibly reported to vendors, and received confirmation from both IBM and Oracle. Our results demonstrate that micro-fuzzing finds AC vulnerabilities in real-world software, and that micro-fuzzing with SRI-derived seed inputs outperforms using empty values."

One well-known instance of these attacks is the widespread use of trick banners that use social engineering techniques to lure victims into clicking on deceptive fake links, potentially leading to a malicious domain or malware. A recent and pervasive trend by attackers is to imitate the ""download"" or ""play"" buttons in popular file sharing sites (e.g., one-click hosters, video-streaming sites, bittorrent sites) in an attempt to trick users into clicking on these fake banners instead of the genuine link. In this paper, we explore the problem of automatically assisting Internet users in detecting malicious trick banners and helping them identify the correct link. We present a set of features to characterize trick banners based on their visual properties such as image size, color, placement on the enclosing webpage, whether they contain animation effects, and whether they consistently appear with the same visual properties on consecutive loads of the same webpage. We have implemented a tool called TrueClick, which uses image processing and machine learning techniques to build a classifier based on these features to automatically detect the trick banners on a webpage. Our approach automatically classifies trick banners, and requires no manual effort to compile blacklists as current approaches do. Our experiments show that TrueClick results in a 3.55 factor improvement in correct link selection in the absence of other ad blocking software, and that it can detect trick banners missed by a popular ad detection tool, Adblock Plus."

DOI: 10.1145/3548606.3560594","This paper proposes using a logic programming language to disentangle X.509 certificate validation policy from mechanism. Expressing validation policies in a logic programming language provides multiple benefits. First, policy and mechanism can be more independently written, augmented, and analyzed compared to the current practice of interweaving them within a C or C++ implementation. Once written, these policies can be easily shared and modified for use in different TLS clients. Further, logic programming allows us to determine when clients differ in their policies and use the power of imputation to automatically generate interesting certificates, e.g., a certificate that will be accepted by one browser but not by another. We present a new framework called Hammurabi for expressing validation policies, and we demonstrate that we can express the complex policies of the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers in this framework. We confirm the fidelity of the Hammurabi policies by comparing the validation decisions they make with those made by the browsers themselves on over ten million certificate chains derived from Certificate Transparency logs, as well as 100K synthetic chains. We also use imputation to discover nine validation differences between the two browsers' policies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Hammurabi into Firefox and the Go language in less than 100 lines of code each."

Over the years, informal conventions or ""norms"" for transaction ordering have, however, emerged via the use of shared software by miners, e.g., the GetBlockTemplate (GBT) mining protocol in Bitcoin Core. Today, a widely held view is that Bitcoin miners prioritize transactions based on their offered ""transaction fee-per-byte."" Bitcoin users are, consequently, encouraged to increase the fees to accelerate the commitment of their transactions, particularly during periods of congestion. In this paper, we audit the Bitcoin blockchain and present statistically significant evidence of mining pools deviating from the norms to accelerate the commitment of transactions for which they have (i) a selfish or vested interest, or (ii) received dark-fee payments via opaque (non-public) side-channels. As blockchains are increasingly being used as a record-keeping substrate for a variety of decentralized (financial technology) systems, our findings call for an urgent discussion on defining neutrality norms that miners must adhere to when ordering transactions in the chains.

This impedes system manageability, growth, and overall provisioning. In turn, large-scale content providers are forced to use staggering numbers of addresses, ultimately leading to address exhaustion (IPv4) and inefficiency (IPv6). In this paper, we revisit IP bindings, entirely. We attempt to evolve addressing conventions by decoupling IP in DNS and from network sockets. Alongside technologies such as SNI and ECMP, a new architecture emerges that ``unbinds'' IP from services and servers, thereby returning IP's role to merely that of reachability. The architecture is under evaluation at a major CDN in multiple datacenters. We show that addresses can be generated randomly \emph{per-query}, for 20M+ domains and services, from as few as ~4K addresses, 256 addresses, and even \emph{one} IP address. We explain why this approach is transparent to routing, L4/L7 load-balancers, distributed caching, and all surrounding systems -- and is \emph{highly desirable}. Our experience suggests that many network-oriented systems and services (e.g., route leak mitigation, denial of service, measurement) could be improved, and new ones designed, if built with addressing agility."

Achieving this goal, however, is complex: the developer must (1) deeply engage with social and legal facets of ""fairness"" in a given context, (2) develop software that concretizes these values, and (3) undergo an independent algorithm audit to ensure technical correctness and social accountability of their algorithms. To date, there are few examples of companies that have transparently undertaken all three steps. In this paper we outline a framework for algorithmic auditing by way of a case-study of pymetrics, a startup that uses machine learning to recommend job candidates to their clients. We discuss how pymetrics approaches the question of fairness given the constraints of ethical, regulatory, and client demands, and how pymetrics' software implements adverse impact testing. We also present the results of an independent audit of pymetrics' candidate screening tool. We conclude with recommendations on how to structure audits to be practical, independent, and constructive, so that companies have better incentive to participate in third party audits, and that watchdog groups can be better prepared to investigate companies."

Uber is a ""ride sharing"" service that matches willing drivers with customers looking for rides. However, unlike other open marketplaces (e.g., AirBnB), Uber is a black-box: they do not provide data about supply or demand, and prices are set dynamically by an opaque ""surge pricing"" algorithm. The lack of transparency has led to concerns about whether Uber artificially manipulate prices, and whether dynamic prices are fair to customers and drivers. In order to understand the impact of surge pricing on passengers and drivers, we present the first in-depth investigation of Uber. We gathered four weeks of data from Uber by emulating 43 copies of the Uber smartphone app and distributing them throughout downtown San Francisco (SF) and midtown Manhattan. Using our dataset, we are able to characterize the dynamics of Uber in SF and Manhattan, as well as identify key implementation details of Uber's surge price algorithm. Our observations about Uber's surge price algorithm raise important questions about the fairness and transparency of this system."

DOI: 10.1145/2815675.2815691","Traffic differentiation---giving better (or worse) performance to certain classes of Internet traffic---is a well-known but poorly understood traffic management policy. There is active discussion on whether and how ISPs should be allowed to differentiate Internet traffic, but little data about current practices to inform this discussion. Previous work attempted to address this problem for fixed line networks; however, there is currently no solution that works in the more challenging mobile environment. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the first system and mobile app for identifying traffic differentiation for arbitrary applications in the mobile environment (i.e., wireless networks such as cellular and WiFi, used by smartphones and tablets). The key idea is to use a VPN proxy to record and replay the network traffic generated by arbitrary applications, and compare it with the network behavior when replaying this traffic outside of an encrypted tunnel. We perform the first known testbed experiments with actual commercial shaping devices to validate our system design and demonstrate how it outperforms previous work for detecting differentiation. We released our app and collected differentiation results from 12 ISPs in 5 countries. We find that differentiation tends to affect TCP traffic (reducing rates by up to 60%) and that interference from middleboxes (including video-transcoding devices) is pervasive. By exposing such behavior, we hope to improve transparency for users and help inform future policies."

Administrators can define intents that capture the overall behavior they want from the network, and an IBN controller compiles such intents into low-level configurations that get installed in the network and implement the desired behavior. We discovered that current IBN specifications and implementations do not specify that flow rule installation orderings should be enforced, which leads to temporal vulnerabilities where, for a limited time, attackers can exploit indeterminate connectivity behavior to gain unauthorized network access. In this paper, we analyze the causes of such temporal vulnerabilities and their security impacts with a representative case study via the ONOS IBN implementation. We devise the Phantom Link attack and demonstrate a working exploit to highlight the security impacts. To defend against such attacks, we propose Spotlight, a detection method that can alert a system administrator of risky intent updates prone to exploitable temporal vulnerabilities. Spotlight is effective in identifying risky updates using realistic network topologies and policies. We show that Spotlight can detect risky updates in a mean time of 0.65 seconds for topologies of over 1,300 nodes."

There are multiple Lightning Network client implementations, all of which conform to the same textual specifications known as BOLTs. Several vulnerabilities have been manually discovered, but to-date there have been few works systematically analyzing the security of the Lightning Network. In this work, we take a foundational approach to analyzing the security of the Lightning Network with the help of formal methods. Based on the BOLTs' specifications, we build a detailed formal model of the Lightning Network's single-hop payment protocol and verify it using the Spin model checker. Our model captures both concurrency and error semantics of the payment protocol. We then define several security properties which capture the correct intermediate operation of the protocol, ensuring that the outcome is always certain to both channel peers, and using them we re-discover a known attack previously reported in the literature along with a novel attack, referred to as a Payout Race. A Payout Race consists of a particular sequence of events that can lead to an ambiguity in the protocol in which innocent users can unwittingly lose funds. We confirm the practicality of this attack by reproducing it in a local testbed environment."

Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks."

However, apps introduce significant security challenges that can systemically disrupt network operations, since apps must access or modify data in a shared control plane state. If our understanding of how such data propagate within the control plane is inadequate, apps can co-opt other apps, causing them to poison the control plane's integrity. We present a class of SDN control plane integrity attacks that we call cross-app poisoning (CAP), in which an unprivileged app manipulates the shared control plane state to trick a privileged app into taking actions on its behalf. We demonstrate how role-based access control (RBAC) schemes are insufficient for preventing such attacks because they neither track information flow nor enforce information flow control (IFC). We also present a defense, ProvSDN, that uses data provenance to track information flow and serves as an online reference monitor to prevent CAP attacks. We implement ProvSDN on the ONOS SDN controller and demonstrate that information flow can be tracked with low-latency overheads."

We propose a theoretically-grounded optimization framework specifically designed for linear regression and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of datasets and models.

Specifically, our protocol enables two parties to compute all pairs of elements from their respective sets that are within a given Hamming distance, without constraints on how these sets are structured. Our key insight is that securely computing the (threshold) Hamming distance between two inputs can be reduced to securely computing their inner product. Leveraging this reduction, we construct a Fuzzy PSI protocol using recent techniques for inner-product predicate encryption. To enable the use of predicate encryption in our setting, we establish that these predicate encryption schemes satisfy a weak notion of simulation security and demonstrate how their internal key derivation can be efficiently distributed without a trusted third party. As a result, our Fuzzy PSI on top of predicate encryption features not only asymptotically optimal linear communication complexity but is also concretely practical. BibTeX Copy to clipboard"

This paradigm will be the foundation of future cellular core networks beyond 5G. The new architecture splits network functionalities into smaller logical entities that can be disaggregated logically, physically, and geographically. This affords interoperability between the mobile network operators and commercial software and hardware vendors or cloud providers. By making use of commodity services and products, this system construct inherits the vulnerabilities in those underlying technologies, thereby increasing its attack surface and requiring a rigorous security analysis. In this work, we review the security implications introduced in B5G networks, and the security mechanisms that are supported by the 5G standard. We emphasize on the support of Zero Trust Architecture in 5G and its relevance in decentralized deployments. We revisit the definition of trust in modern enterprise network operations and identify important Zero Trust properties that are weakened by the nature of cloud deployments. To that end, we propose a vertical extension of Zero Trust, namely, Zero Trust Execution, to model untrusted execution environments, and we provide an analysis on how to establish trust in Beyond-5G network architectures using Trusted Execution Environments.

These applications are typically used to provide departure clearance, en-route services such as altitude and flight plan changes, air traffic surveillance and reporting, and radio frequency assignments. Unlike most attacks proposed so far where the attacker influences decision-making through manipulated instruments, attacks on aviation datalink provide adversaries with a new attack vector to influence the flight crew’s decision-making through direct instructions. In this work, we perform a security analysis of these applications and outline the requirements for executing a successful attack. Specifically, we propose a coordinated multi-aircraft attack and show how an adversary capable of spoofing datalink messages and reactive jamming can influence the flight crew’s decision-making. Through geospatial analysis of historical flight data, we identify 48 vulnerable regions where an attacker has a 90% chance of encountering favorable conditions for coordinated multi-aircraft attacks. Next, we implement a reactive jammer that ensures stealthy attack execution by targeting messages from a specific aircraft with a reaction time of 1.48 ms and 98.85% jamming success. Even though by themselves these attacks have a lower probability of endangering the safety of the aircraft, the threat is magnified when combined with attacks on other avionics. Finally, we discuss the possibility of executing integrated attacks on aircraft system as a whole emphasizing the importance of securing individual components in the aviation ecosystem."

Our approach and system DEFORM, a Deep Learning (DL) based RX beamforming achieves significant gain for multi antenna RF receivers while being agnostic to the transmitted signal features (e.g., modulation or bandwidth). It is well known that combining coherent RF signals from multiple antennas results in a beamforming gain proportional to the number of receiving elements. However in practice, this approach heavily relies on explicit channel estimation techniques, which are link specific and require significant communication overhead to be transmitted to the receiver. DEFORM addresses this challenge by leveraging Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the channel characteristics in particular the relative phase to antenna elements. It is specifically designed to address the unique features of wireless signals complex samples, such as the ambiguous2πphase discontinuity and the high sensitivity of the link Bit Error Rate. The channel prediction is subsequently used in the Maximum Ratio Combining algorithm to achieve an optimal combination of the received signals. While being trained on a fixed, basic RF settings, we show that DEFORM DL model is universal, achieving up to 3 dB of SNR gain for a two antenna receiver in extensive experiments demonstrating various settings of modulations, bandwidths, and channels. The universality of DEFORM is demonstrated through joint beamforming relaying of LoRa (Chirp Spread Spectrum modulation) and ZigBee signals, achieving significant improvements to Packet Loss/Delivery Rates relatively to conventional Amplify and Forward (LoRa PLR reduced by 23 times and ZigBee PDR increased by 8 times)."

In this paper, we are concerned with the design and evaluation of a universal anti-jamming building block, that is agnostic to the specifics of the communication link and can therefore be combined with existing technologies. We believe that such a block should not require explicit probes, sounding, training sequences, channel estimation, or even the cooperation of the transmitter. To meet these requirements, we propose an approach that relies on advances in Machine Learning, and the promises of neural accelerators and software defined radios. We identify and address multiple challenges, resulting in a convolutional neural network architecture and models for a multi-antenna system to infer the existence of interference, the number of interfering emissions and their respective phases. This information is continuously fed into an algorithm that cancels the interfering signal. We develop a two-antenna prototype system and evaluate our jamming cancellation approach in various environment settings and modulation schemes using Software Defined Radio platforms. We demonstrate that the receiving node equipped with our approach can detect a jammer with over 99% of accuracy and achieve a Bit Error Rate (BER) as low as10−6even when the jammer power is nearly two orders of magnitude (18 dB) higher than the legitimate signal, and without requiring modifications to the link modulation.

In particular, being able to plausibly deny that a hard disk contains certain information is a very useful and interesting research goal. However, it has been known for some time that existing ``hidden volume'' solutions, like TrueCrypt, fail in the face of an adversary who is able to observe the contents of a disk on multiple, separate occasions. In this work, we explore more robust constructions for hidden volumes and present HiVE, which is resistant to more powerful adversaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. In pursuit of this, we propose the first security definitions for hidden volumes, and prove HiVE secure under these definitions. At the core of HiVE, we design a new write-only Oblivious RAM. We show that, when only hiding writes, it is possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O(1) communication complexity and only poly-logarithmic user memory. This is a significant improvement over existing work and an independently interesting result. We go on to show that our write-only ORAM is specially equipped to provide hidden volume functionality with low overhead and significantly increased security. Finally, we implement HiVE as a Linux kernel block device to show both its practicality and usefulness on existing platforms."

However, they are challenging to implement correctly because they have to deal with any unexpected message from byzantine peers and ensure safety and liveness at all times. Many formal frameworks have been developed to verify the safety of SMR implementations, but there is still a gap in the verification of their liveness. Existing liveness proofs are either limited to the network level or do not cover popular partially synchronous protocols. We introduce LiDO, a consensus model that enables the verification of both safety and liveness of implementations through refinement. We observe that current consensus models cannot handle liveness because they do not include a pacemaker state. We show that by adding a pacemaker state to the LiDO model, we can express the liveness properties of SMR protocols as a few safety properties that can be easily verified by refinement proofs. Based on our LiDO model, we provide mechanized safety and liveness proofs for both unpipelined and pipelined Jolteon in Coq. This is the first mechanized liveness proof for a byzantine consensus protocol with non-trivial optimizations such as pipelining."

We build on recent work on the atomic distributed object model to fill this void with a novel abstraction called AdoB. In addition to revealing important insights into the essence of consensus, this abstraction has practical benefits for easing distributed system verification. As a case study, we proved safety and liveness properties for AdoB in Coq, which are the first such mechanized proofs to handle benign and byzantine consensus in a unified manner.

As evidence we observe that nearly all of them avoid the complex, but important issue of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration's primary challenge lies in how it interacts with a protocol's core safety invariants. To handle this increased complexity, we introduce the Adore model, whose novel abstract state hides network-level communications while capturing dependencies between committed and uncommitted states, as well as metadata like election quorums. It includes first-class support for a generic reconfiguration command that can be instantiated with a variety of implementations. Under this model, the subtle interactions between reconfiguration and the core protocol become clear, and with this insight we completed the first mechanized proof of safety of a reconfigurable consensus protocol."

Network and node failures are inevitable and, for some applications, careful control over how they are handled is essential. Unfortunately, existing approaches either completely hide these failures behind an atomic state machine replication (SMR) interface, or expose all of the network-level details, sacrificing atomicity. We propose a novel, compositional, atomic distributed object (ADO) model for strongly consistent distributed systems that combines the best of both options. The object-oriented API abstracts over protocol-specific details and decouples high-level correctness reasoning from implementation choices. At the same time, it intentionally exposes an abstract view of certain key distributed failure cases, thus allowing for more fine-grained control over them than SMR-like models. We demonstrate that proving properties even of composite distributed systems can be straightforward with our Coq verification framework, Advert, thanks to the ADO model. We also show that a variety of common protocols including multi-Paxos and Chain Replication refine the ADO semantics, which allows one to freely choose among them for an application's implementation without modifying ADO-level correctness proofs."

For example, a server may spread terabytes of data across many different storage media, ranging from magnetic disks, DRAM, NAND-based solid state drives (SSDs), as well as hybrid drives that package various combinations of these technologies. It follows that access latencies to data can vary hugely depending on which media the data resides on. At the same time, modern storage systems naturally retain older versions of data due to the prevalence of log-structured designs and caches in software and hardware layers. In a sense, a contemporary storage system is very similar to a small-scale distributed system, opening the door to consistency/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose a class of local storage systems called StaleStores that support relaxed consistency, returning stale data for better performance. We describe several examples of StaleStores, and show via emulations that serving stale data can improve access latency by between 35% and 20X. We describe a particular StaleStore called Yogurt, a weakly consistent local block storage system. Depending on the application's consistency requirements (e.g. bounded staleness, mono-tonic reads, read-my-writes, etc.), Yogurt queries the access costs for different versions of data within tolerable staleness bounds and returns the fastest version. We show that a distributed key-value store running on top of Yogurt obtains a 6X speed-up for access latency by trading off consistency and performance within individual storage servers."

As a result, new high-level storage abstractions—and new designs for existing abstractions—are difficult to realize, requiring developers to implement from scratch complex functionality such as failure atomicity and fine-grained concurrency control. In this paper, we argue that pushing transactional isolation into the block store (in addition to atomicity and durability) is both viable and broadly useful, resulting in simpler high-level storage systems that provide strong semantics without sacrificing performance. We present Isotope, a new block store that supports ACID transactions over block reads and writes. Internally, Isotope uses a new multi-version concurrency control protocol that exploits fine-grained, sub-block parallelism in workloads and offers both strict serializability and snapshot isolation guarantees. We implemented several high-level storage systems over Isotope, including two key-value stores that implement the LevelDB API over a hashtable and B-tree, respectively, and a POSIX filesystem. We show that Isotope’s block-level transactions enable systems that are simple (100s of lines of code), robust (i.e., providing ACID guarantees), and fast (e.g., 415 MB/s for random file writes). We also show that these systems can be composed using Isotope, providing applications with transactions across different high-level constructs such as files, directories and key-value pairs.

Traditional system mappings are often hand-crafted and data-agnostic. In this paper, we explore the use of neural networks as learned mappings that are automatically generated and data-dependent, optimizing performance for specific workloads and scenarios. Unlike prior learned structures, we employ a portfolio method consisting of a set of independent neural networks, each responsible for making sole decisions. Our preliminary results indicate that these portfolio mappings can generalize across multiple applications."

We consider machines that can be configured into smaller instances, which we call blocks, in multiple ways, each of which is referred to as a configuration. We introduce the Configurable Machine Scheduling (cms) problem, where we are given n jobs and a set C of configurations. A schedule consists of a set of machines, each assigned some configuration in C with each block in the configuration assigned to process one job. The amount of a job’s demand that is satisfied by a block is given by an arbitrary function of the job and block. The objective is to construct a schedule using as few machines as possible. We provide a tight logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this problem in the general setting, a factor (3 + ε) approximation algorithm for arbitrary ε > 0 when there are O(1) input configurations, and a polynomial time approximation scheme when both the number and size of configurations are O(1). Finally, we utilize a technique for finding conic integer combinations in fixed dimension to develop an optimal polynomial time algorithm in the case with O(1) jobs, O(1) blocks, and every configuration up to a given size."

Bugs in these compilers can result in models whose semantics differ from the original ones, producing incorrect results that corrupt the correctness of downstream applications. However, finding bugs in these compilers is challenging due to their complexity. In this work, we propose a new fuzz testing approach for finding bugs in deep-learning compilers. Our core approach consists of (i) generating diverse yet valid DNN test models that can exercise a large part of the compiler's transformation logic using light-weight operator specifications; (ii) performing gradient-based search to find model inputs that avoid any floating-point exceptional values during model execution, reducing the chance of missed bugs or false alarms; and (iii) using differential testing to identify bugs. We implemented this approach in NNSmith which has found 72 new bugs for TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch to date. Of these 58 have been confirmed and 51 have been fixed by their respective project maintainers."

Yet, this swift growth brings with it substantial challenges, notably the surge in scam tokens, imposing significant security threats on cryptocurrency investments and trading. Existing detection methods of scam token, primarily relying on analyzing contract codes or transaction patterns, struggle to catch increasingly sophisticated tactics employed by scammers. For example, contract-based analysis are unable to identify scams lacking overt malicious code, e.g., most rugpulls, while transaction-based methods generally lack the foresight to early-detect potential risks. In this paper, we present TokenScout, the first temporal temporal graph neural network-based framework for scam token early detection. TokenScout formulates token transfer data as a dynamic temporal attributed multigraph and leverages the temporal graph learning model to learn graph representations. It also builds a graph representation refining model based on contrastive learning to learn a more discriminative representation space for risk identification. We evaluated TokenScout using a comprehensive dataset of 214,084 standard ERC20 tokens from 2015 to February 2023. TokenScout achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.41%. Additionally, from March to May 2023, deploying TokenScout on Ethereum effectively identified 706 rugpulls, 174 honeypots, and 90 Ponzi schemes, thereby alerting to potential risks exceeding 240 million."

One approach to prevent such attacks is to enforce control-flow integrity (CFI), but inlined CFI enforcement can pose challenges in embedded systems. For example, it increases binary size and changes memory layout. Trace-based control-flow violation detection (CFVD) offers an alternative that doesn't require instrumentation of the protected software or changes to its memory layout. However, existing CFVD methods used in desktop systems require kernel modifications to store and analyze the trace, which limits their use to monitoring unprivileged applications. But, embedded systems are interrupt-driven, with the majority of processing taking place in the privileged mode. Therefore, it is critical to provide a holistic and system-oriented CFVD solution that can monitor control-flow transfers both within and among privileged and unprivileged components. In this paper, we present SHERLOC, a Secure and Holistic Control-Flow Violation Detection mechanism designed for microcontroller-based embedded systems. SHERLOC ensures security by configuring the hardware tracing unit, storing trace records, and executing the violation detection algorithm in a trusted execution environment, which prevents privileged programs from bypassing monitoring or tampering with the trace. We address the challenges of achieving holistic and system-oriented CFVD by formalizing the problem and monitoring forward and backward edges of unprivileged and privileged programs, as well as control-flow transfers among unprivileged and privileged components. Specifically, SHERLOC overcomes the challenges of identifying legitimate asynchronous interrupts and context switches at run-time by using an interrupt- and scheduling-aware violation detection algorithm. Our evaluations on the ARMv8-M architecture demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SHERLOC."
