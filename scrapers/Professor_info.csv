Zhengzhong Jin is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston. He is a member of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute.
As a researcher and teacher, Jin’s focus is on cryptography, which he grew passionate about during his undergraduate courses in theoretical computer science. In particular, he has worked to develop a proof system that enables clients to delegate heavy computation to an untrusted server and still ensure that the computation is done correctly. These cryptographic proofs can be applied in many practical areas, including blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.
Before joining Khoury College in 2024, Jin was a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a winner of multiple best paper awards at conferences such as EUROCRYPT and ACNS. He has been a member of the program committee for multiple conferences, including TCC 2023, PKC 2024, and CRYPTO 2024.
Jin also plans to involve himself in quantum computing and machine learning research in the future. He believes that those areas may present challenges and exciting possibilities for cryptography.",2024-11-06,SNARGs under LWE via Propositional Proofs,"Citation: Zhengzhong Jin, Yael Kalai, Alex Lombardi, Vinod Vaikuntanathan.

Lace Padilla is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Science at Northeastern University, based in Boston and Oakland.
With a background in cognitive and neural sciences, Padilla uses evidence-based data visualization techniques to accurately convey uncertainty, helping people to make informed decisions about high-stakes topics like medical treatments and emergency evacuations. Her work evaluates the impact of basic cognitive mechanisms like working memory, attention, perception, and knowledge on how people process data visualizations, as well as the impact of marginalizing factors like low literacy on visualization comprehension. Padilla collaborates with domain experts to develop more effective scientific communication techniques, and she also developed the only visualization decision-making model that integrates modern theories from visualization science, cognitive science, and human–computer interaction. Her publication record includes more than 25 peer-reviewed publications, a government report, two book chapters, an edited book, and seven peer-reviewed conference proceedings, plus honors including an NSF CAREER Award, an IEEE VIS Best Paper Award, and an APA Early Career Award. 
Padilla joined Khoury College in 2023, attracted by the opportunity to work with the Visualization Group, which she describes as the world’s most vibrant hub for data visualization research. She is eager to explore cutting-edge data visualization techniques and applications with like-minded experts, push the field further, and help her students to become educated information consumers and ethical information producers.

Rush Sanghrajka is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston. 
When Sanghrajka discovered computational narratives after an adolescence filled with creative writing and narrative video games, he knew immediately it was what he wanted to pursue. The field uses computer intelligence to tell stories effectively and across media — music to the ears of a young computer scientist with a passion for the universality of storytelling. In that vein, Sanghrajka has worked at Disney Research developing scriptwriting assistance technologies and at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies to develop a conversation-based tutoring system.  
Sanghrajka’s other major passion is computer science pedagogy, especially working with programming beginners and helping them find ways that computing can intersect with their other interests. After teaching stints at Rutgers University and the University of Utah, he began teaching his first classes at Khoury College in 2024 with an eye toward preparing students for co-op.  
Sanghrajka has received the Educational Advances in AI New and Future Educator Award, and he has presented work at several conferences, including Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Digital Entertainment, the Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, the Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence, and the International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling. 
In his free time, Sanghrajka enjoys narrative-focused video games, hiking, running with his dog, and exploring cozy coffee shops.",,,

Rajagopal Venkatesaramani is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston. 
Venkat is particularly interested in privacy as it relates to genomic data, especially as the collection, sharing, and linkage of such data becomes more prevalent. As such, he uses large-scale optimization, adversarial machine learning techniques, and game-theoretic frameworks to enable privacy–utility trade-offs when sharing genomic data. He also has an interest in natural language processing and graph theory. Venkat has published work with Science Advances, ACM TOPS, and Genome Research, and has presented at RECOMB and at the Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics. 
Venkat joined Khoury College in 2023, drawn in by the college’s commitment to CS for everyone. He has a research interest in computer science education and is excited to explore innovations in course design while introducing students to state-of-the-art tools and technologies. He is also interested in exploring natural language processing and generative AI research projects through ethical and theoretical lenses.  
When he’s not working, Venkat pursues his love for Indian classical music; he has over 20 years of training in Carnatic vocals and has taught himself several instruments, including the bansuri, an Indian bamboo flute.

Bockmon also built and distributed course material as part of the Click2CS 4-H initiative, taught courses in data science and statistics, and published at multiple ACM conferences. 
After struggling in his own undergraduate computing studies, Bockmon remains motivated to improve the areas of the student experience he found lacking in support, and to shave down student failure rates by doing so. In Portland, he teaches the “Algorithms,” “Data Mining,” “Introduction to programming for Data Science,” and “Computer Vision” master’s courses, and aims to build hands-on learning experiences — and thus a more student-centric approach — using an augmented reality sandbox.

Michael Ann DeVito is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
DeVito is dedicated to addressing inequalities and unfairness toward marginalized populations that are caused or exacerbated by AI- and machine-learning-driven sociotechnical systems. Inspired by her own experiences, she positions herself as a member-researcher and aims to use folk theorization and her expertise in user understanding to return agency to marginalized users. DeVito believes that equitable design and AI can only be achieved by holistically accounting for these communities, including sapphics, transfeminine people, and neurodivergent folks.
Before joining Khoury College, DeVito wore many hats, from Northwestern University instructor to University of Colorado Boulder postdoctoral fellow to managing editor and producer for Planet Forward, George Washington University’s environment-focused science communication institute. She has published regularly at CSCW and CHI, and her work has been recognized by the former with diversity-related and “best paper” honors.
DeVito joined Khoury College in 2023 with the goal of continuing her work with marginalized communities, as well as training, funding, and supporting junior researchers from those communities. In the classroom, she teaches ethical AI and machine learning, user understanding, and qualitative and community-focused research methods, firmly believing that a good computer scientist requires both technical skill and deep context on users and communities to avoid creating harmful tech.
Outside of academia, DeVito is an avid video game player and modifier, a casual bass guitarist, and a mom to cats Julian and Jadzia.",2024-08-11,Moving Towards Epistemic Autonomy: A Paradigm Shift for Centering Participant Knowledge,"Citation: Leah Hope Ajmani, Talia Bhatt, Michael Ann DeVito.

Zhengzhong Jin is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston. He is a member of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute.
As a researcher and teacher, Jin’s focus is on cryptography, which he grew passionate about during his undergraduate courses in theoretical computer science. In particular, he has worked to develop a proof system that enables clients to delegate heavy computation to an untrusted server and still ensure that the computation is done correctly. These cryptographic proofs can be applied in many practical areas, including blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.
Before joining Khoury College in 2024, Jin was a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a winner of multiple best paper awards at conferences such as EUROCRYPT and ACNS. He has been a member of the program committee for multiple conferences, including TCC 2023, PKC 2024, and CRYPTO 2024.
Jin also plans to involve himself in quantum computing and machine learning research in the future. He believes that those areas may present challenges and exciting possibilities for cryptography.",2023-09-08,Correlation Intractability and SNARGs from Sub-exponential DDH,"Citation: Arka Rai Choudhuri, Sanjam Garg, Abhishek Jain , Zhengzhong Jin, Jiaheng Zhang.

Michael Correll is an associate research professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based at the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine. 
Correll’s journey to his data science and visualization pursuits was a long and winding one, beginning with visualizing analyses of Shakespeare writing patterns, transitioning into an interest in how people find statistical patterns in charts and graphs, and morphing into a passion for data uncertainty in the face of high stakes and decision-making biases. The upshot was a drive to create reliable, inclusive, and informative visualizations for nonexpert audiences, and to help people make accurate decisions based on data. In taking this route, Correll has published at IEEE VIS, TVCG, and EuroVis, as well as CHI, where three of his papers earned best paper honorable mentions. 
Before joining Khoury College in 2023, Correll was also a researcher, speaker, writer, and product advisor at Tableau Research, where he worked on the visual communication of statistical models, visualization and data ethics, epistemology in data science, and designs for auditing and verifying visual analytics. This followed his time as a research associate in the Interactive Data Lab at the University of Washington. Now, in the newest phase of his career, Correll is excited to work with world-class data experts, apply his work to real-world problems, delve into explainable AI from a rhetorical perspective, and build a body of interdisciplinary work around his core research interests.

Lace Padilla is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Science at Northeastern University, based in Boston and Oakland.
With a background in cognitive and neural sciences, Padilla uses evidence-based data visualization techniques to accurately convey uncertainty, helping people to make informed decisions about high-stakes topics like medical treatments and emergency evacuations. Her work evaluates the impact of basic cognitive mechanisms like working memory, attention, perception, and knowledge on how people process data visualizations, as well as the impact of marginalizing factors like low literacy on visualization comprehension. Padilla collaborates with domain experts to develop more effective scientific communication techniques, and she also developed the only visualization decision-making model that integrates modern theories from visualization science, cognitive science, and human–computer interaction. Her publication record includes more than 25 peer-reviewed publications, a government report, two book chapters, an edited book, and seven peer-reviewed conference proceedings, plus honors including an NSF CAREER Award, an IEEE VIS Best Paper Award, and an APA Early Career Award. 
Padilla joined Khoury College in 2023, attracted by the opportunity to work with the Visualization Group, which she describes as the world’s most vibrant hub for data visualization research. She is eager to explore cutting-edge data visualization techniques and applications with like-minded experts, push the field further, and help her students to become educated information consumers and ethical information producers.

Brianna Dym is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based at the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine. 
Before joining Khoury College in 2023, Dym lectured at the University of Maine, where she strove to reimagine computing curricula and boost computing participation for students from nontraditional and underrepresented backgrounds. She feels compelled to research and remedy inequities, ensure that everyone benefits from new technologies, and foster technology-enabled community among LGBTQ+ students after finding that community online as a teenager. 
Dym is continuing these efforts within Khoury College’s Align program, where she intends to empower master’s students from underrepresented communities to explore careers in human–computer interaction (HCI), data science, and computing in general. She teaches “Human–Computer Interaction” and “Programming Design Paradigms,” driven by her passion for introductory computing topics, social computing, and HCI. 
In addition, Dym is interested in expanding her research to integrate her expertise in sociolinguistics and phonetics.

Brianna Dym is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based at the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine. 
Before joining Khoury College in 2023, Dym lectured at the University of Maine, where she strove to reimagine computing curricula and boost computing participation for students from nontraditional and underrepresented backgrounds. She feels compelled to research and remedy inequities, ensure that everyone benefits from new technologies, and foster technology-enabled community among LGBTQ+ students after finding that community online as a teenager. 
Dym is continuing these efforts within Khoury College’s Align program, where she intends to empower master’s students from underrepresented communities to explore careers in human–computer interaction (HCI), data science, and computing in general. She teaches “Human–Computer Interaction” and “Programming Design Paradigms,” driven by her passion for introductory computing topics, social computing, and HCI.

Rush Sanghrajka is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston. 
When Sanghrajka discovered computational narratives after an adolescence filled with creative writing and narrative video games, he knew immediately it was what he wanted to pursue. The field uses computer intelligence to tell stories effectively and across media — music to the ears of a young computer scientist with a passion for the universality of storytelling. In that vein, Sanghrajka has worked at Disney Research developing scriptwriting assistance technologies and at the USC Institute for Creative Technologies to develop a conversation-based tutoring system.  
Sanghrajka’s other major passion is computer science pedagogy, especially working with programming beginners and helping them find ways that computing can intersect with their other interests. After teaching stints at Rutgers University and the University of Utah, he began teaching his first classes at Khoury College in 2024 with an eye toward preparing students for co-op.  
Sanghrajka has received the Educational Advances in AI New and Future Educator Award, and he has presented work at several conferences, including Artificial Intelligence for Interactive Digital Entertainment, the Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, the Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence, and the International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling. 
In his free time, Sanghrajka enjoys narrative-focused video games, hiking, running with his dog, and exploring cozy coffee shops.",,,

To focuses on human–computer interaction, particularly on centering and uplifting marginalized people through computing and tech. She is interested not just in inclusion, but in how marginalized people can flourish and use tech to access joy, play, and justice. This research requires plenty of collaboration and ongoing learning, which keeps To engaged and on her toes. To has received a host of awards and recognitions for this work, including the Best Paper Award at ACM’s CHI, UIST, DIS, and CSCW conferences, plus a CSCW Recognition for Contribution to Diversity and Inclusion.
At Khoury College, where she has researched and taught since 2020, To teaches foundational courses in human–computer interaction. Students often take her courses after a long series of deeply technical classes, and she enjoys guiding them in their reflections about who their technology is for and why. To particularly loves to pursue a disparate collection of research projects, both those born of her own passions and those put forth by her student collaborators.
In her free time, To enjoys tabletop roleplaying games, fantasy video games, cooking, and tarot.","Recent publications

Alexandra To is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
To focuses on human–computer interaction, particularly on centering and uplifting marginalized people through computing and tech. She is interested not just in inclusion, but in how marginalized people can flourish and use tech to access joy, play, and justice. This research requires plenty of collaboration and ongoing learning, which keeps To engaged and on her toes. To has received a host of awards and recognitions for this work, including the Best Paper Award at ACM’s CHI, UIST, DIS, and CSCW conferences, plus a CSCW Recognition for Contribution to Diversity and Inclusion.
At Khoury College, where she has researched and taught since 2020, To teaches foundational courses in human–computer interaction. Students often take her courses after a long series of deeply technical classes, and she enjoys guiding them in their reflections about who their technology is for and why. To particularly loves to pursue a disparate collection of research projects, both those born of her own passions and those put forth by her student collaborators.
In her free time, To enjoys tabletop roleplaying games, fantasy video games, cooking, and tarot.","Recent publications

Michael Ann DeVito is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
DeVito is dedicated to addressing inequalities and unfairness toward marginalized populations that are caused or exacerbated by AI- and machine-learning-driven sociotechnical systems. Inspired by her own experiences, she positions herself as a member-researcher and aims to use folk theorization and her expertise in user understanding to return agency to marginalized users. DeVito believes that equitable design and AI can only be achieved by holistically accounting for these communities, including sapphics, transfeminine people, and neurodivergent folks.
Before joining Khoury College, DeVito wore many hats, from Northwestern University instructor to University of Colorado Boulder postdoctoral fellow to managing editor and producer for Planet Forward, George Washington University’s environment-focused science communication institute. She has published regularly at CSCW and CHI, and her work has been recognized by the former with diversity-related and “best paper” honors.
DeVito joined Khoury College in 2023 with the goal of continuing her work with marginalized communities, as well as training, funding, and supporting junior researchers from those communities. In the classroom, she teaches ethical AI and machine learning, user understanding, and qualitative and community-focused research methods, firmly believing that a good computer scientist requires both technical skill and deep context on users and communities to avoid creating harmful tech.

Brianna Dym is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based at the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine. 
Before joining Khoury College in 2023, Dym lectured at the University of Maine, where she strove to reimagine computing curricula and boost computing participation for students from nontraditional and underrepresented backgrounds. She feels compelled to research and remedy inequities, ensure that everyone benefits from new technologies, and foster technology-enabled community among LGBTQ+ students after finding that community online as a teenager. 
Dym is continuing these efforts within Khoury College’s Align program, where she intends to empower master’s students from underrepresented communities to explore careers in human–computer interaction (HCI), data science, and computing in general. She teaches “Human–Computer Interaction” and “Programming Design Paradigms,” driven by her passion for introductory computing topics, social computing, and HCI. 
In addition, Dym is interested in expanding her research to integrate her expertise in sociolinguistics and phonetics.

Brianna Dym is an assistant teaching professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based at the Roux Institute in Portland, Maine. 
Before joining Khoury College in 2023, Dym lectured at the University of Maine, where she strove to reimagine computing curricula and boost computing participation for students from nontraditional and underrepresented backgrounds. She feels compelled to research and remedy inequities, ensure that everyone benefits from new technologies, and foster technology-enabled community among LGBTQ+ students after finding that community online as a teenager. 
Dym is continuing these efforts within Khoury College’s Align program, where she intends to empower master’s students from underrepresented communities to explore careers in human–computer interaction (HCI), data science, and computing in general. She teaches “Human–Computer Interaction” and “Programming Design Paradigms,” driven by her passion for introductory computing topics, social computing, and HCI. 
In addition, Dym is interested in expanding her research to integrate her expertise in sociolinguistics and phonetics.

Christopher Le Dantec is a professor and the director of digital civics in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston. 
Le Dantec has always been concerned with how social value systems are reflected in technology, so his digital civics research applies human-centered computing to the intersection of digital democracy and smart cities. In particular, he develops novel computing interfaces and capacities that support collective action through the production and use of civic data. Le Dantec develops prototypes and demonstration systems through collaboration with community partners — including grassroots community organizations and advocacy groups from underrepresented communities — to meet their needs. By exploring how different value systems and priorities are negotiated through data and technology, he reframes research from ideas of command and control (e.g., smart cities) and efficiency and productivity (e.g., the workplace) toward ideas of inclusion, mutual aid, and care. 
Le Dantec joined Northeastern in 2023 to build out global initiatives in this same vein. Previously, he was an associate professor in Georgia Tech’s School of Interactive Computing, where he directed or co-directed the Human-Centered PhD Program, the MS-HCI Program, and the Public Participation Lab.

Lace Padilla is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Science at Northeastern University, based in Boston and Oakland.
With a background in cognitive and neural sciences, Padilla uses evidence-based data visualization techniques to accurately convey uncertainty, helping people to make informed decisions about high-stakes topics like medical treatments and emergency evacuations. Her work evaluates the impact of basic cognitive mechanisms like working memory, attention, perception, and knowledge on how people process data visualizations, as well as the impact of marginalizing factors like low literacy on visualization comprehension. Padilla collaborates with domain experts to develop more effective scientific communication techniques, and she also developed the only visualization decision-making model that integrates modern theories from visualization science, cognitive science, and human–computer interaction. Her publication record includes more than 25 peer-reviewed publications, a government report, two book chapters, an edited book, and seven peer-reviewed conference proceedings, plus honors including an NSF CAREER Award, an IEEE VIS Best Paper Award, and an APA Early Career Award. 
Padilla joined Khoury College in 2023, attracted by the opportunity to work with the Visualization Group, which she describes as the world’s most vibrant hub for data visualization research. She is eager to explore cutting-edge data visualization techniques and applications with like-minded experts, push the field further, and help her students to become educated information consumers and ethical information producers.

Zhi Tan is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
Tan’s research explores human–robot interaction, specifically how robots interact with the world and how to integrate multiple robots and intelligent systems. His doctoral thesis work began with the assumption that a single robot would likely be unable to complete all given tasks, then explored how a robot should transfer its user to another robot with different capacities. Then, as a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Tan developed and evaluated AI technologies to help adults with mild cognitive impairments and their care partners to live independently at home. He has published with — or presented at — ACM/IEEE HRI, ACM ASSETS, ACM ICMI, IEEE IROS, and IEEE RO-MAN.
Tan joined Khoury College in 2023, drawn by the school’s collaborative, hands-on ethos. He is excited to help graduate and undergraduate students gain practical experience designing algorithms and systems that enable robots to work with users and other intelligent systems. He is also interested in collaborating with colleagues at and beyond Northeastern on machine learning and large language models.
When he’s not working, Tan enjoys visiting national parks and collecting National Park Service cancellation stamps.",,,

Alexandra To is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
To focuses on human–computer interaction, particularly on centering and uplifting marginalized people through computing and tech. She is interested not just in inclusion, but in how marginalized people can flourish and use tech to access joy, play, and justice. This research requires plenty of collaboration and ongoing learning, which keeps To engaged and on her toes. To has received a host of awards and recognitions for this work, including the Best Paper Award at ACM’s CHI, UIST, DIS, and CSCW conferences, plus a CSCW Recognition for Contribution to Diversity and Inclusion.
At Khoury College, where she has researched and taught since 2020, To teaches foundational courses in human–computer interaction. Students often take her courses after a long series of deeply technical classes, and she enjoys guiding them in their reflections about who their technology is for and why. To particularly loves to pursue a disparate collection of research projects, both those born of her own passions and those put forth by her student collaborators.
In her free time, To enjoys tabletop roleplaying games, fantasy video games, cooking, and tarot.","Recent publications

Alexandra To is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
To focuses on human–computer interaction, particularly on centering and uplifting marginalized people through computing and tech. She is interested not just in inclusion, but in how marginalized people can flourish and use tech to access joy, play, and justice. This research requires plenty of collaboration and ongoing learning, which keeps To engaged and on her toes. To has received a host of awards and recognitions for this work, including the Best Paper Award at ACM’s CHI, UIST, DIS, and CSCW conferences, plus a CSCW Recognition for Contribution to Diversity and Inclusion.
At Khoury College, where she has researched and taught since 2020, To teaches foundational courses in human–computer interaction. Students often take her courses after a long series of deeply technical classes, and she enjoys guiding them in their reflections about who their technology is for and why. To particularly loves to pursue a disparate collection of research projects, both those born of her own passions and those put forth by her student collaborators.
In her free time, To enjoys tabletop roleplaying games, fantasy video games, cooking, and tarot.","Recent publications

Alexandra To is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
To focuses on human–computer interaction, particularly on centering and uplifting marginalized people through computing and tech. She is interested not just in inclusion, but in how marginalized people can flourish and use tech to access joy, play, and justice. This research requires plenty of collaboration and ongoing learning, which keeps To engaged and on her toes. To has received a host of awards and recognitions for this work, including the Best Paper Award at ACM’s CHI, UIST, DIS, and CSCW conferences, plus a CSCW Recognition for Contribution to Diversity and Inclusion.
At Khoury College, where she has researched and taught since 2020, To teaches foundational courses in human–computer interaction. Students often take her courses after a long series of deeply technical classes, and she enjoys guiding them in their reflections about who their technology is for and why. To particularly loves to pursue a disparate collection of research projects, both those born of her own passions and those put forth by her student collaborators.
In her free time, To enjoys tabletop roleplaying games, fantasy video games, cooking, and tarot.","Recent publications

Alexandra To is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
To focuses on human–computer interaction, particularly on centering and uplifting marginalized people through computing and tech. She is interested not just in inclusion, but in how marginalized people can flourish and use tech to access joy, play, and justice. This research requires plenty of collaboration and ongoing learning, which keeps To engaged and on her toes. To has received a host of awards and recognitions for this work, including the Best Paper Award at ACM’s CHI, UIST, DIS, and CSCW conferences, plus a CSCW Recognition for Contribution to Diversity and Inclusion.
At Khoury College, where she has researched and taught since 2020, To teaches foundational courses in human–computer interaction. Students often take her courses after a long series of deeply technical classes, and she enjoys guiding them in their reflections about who their technology is for and why. To particularly loves to pursue a disparate collection of research projects, both those born of her own passions and those put forth by her student collaborators.
In her free time, To enjoys tabletop roleplaying games, fantasy video games, cooking, and tarot.","Recent publications

Chieh Wu is an associate professor at the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston.  
Wu is a prolific machine learning scholar, having published 12 papers in a six-year span while also volunteering as a reviewer for three publications. In recent years, he’s dedicated himself to identifying personalized risk factors and predicting gestational age through a grant from the Opportunity and Infrastructure Fund. He specializes in kernel methods, and his ultimate goal is to discover a unifying mathematical theory for neural networks.  
Wu has been at Northeastern since 2015, first as a doctoral research assistant in the College of Engineering and later as a postdoctoral researcher. He joined the Khoury College faculty ranks in 2023 out of a love of teaching, and he’s excited to bring his passion into the classroom where he can work directly with students. He also believes the intersection of biology and machine learning is a promising research area, and he is interested in building interdisciplinary collaborations around biomarker testing.

Zhi Tan is an assistant professor in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Boston.
Tan’s research explores human–robot interaction, specifically how robots interact with the world and how to integrate multiple robots and intelligent systems. His doctoral thesis work began with the assumption that a single robot would likely be unable to complete all given tasks, then explored how a robot should transfer its user to another robot with different capacities. Then, as a postdoctoral fellow at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Tan developed and evaluated AI technologies to help adults with mild cognitive impairments and their care partners to live independently at home. He has published with — or presented at — ACM/IEEE HRI, ACM ASSETS, ACM ICMI, IEEE IROS, and IEEE RO-MAN.
Tan joined Khoury College in 2023, drawn by the school’s collaborative, hands-on ethos. He is excited to help graduate and undergraduate students gain practical experience designing algorithms and systems that enable robots to work with users and other intelligent systems. He is also interested in collaborating with colleagues at and beyond Northeastern on machine learning and large language models.
When he’s not working, Tan enjoys visiting national parks and collecting National Park Service cancellation stamps.",,,

Ian Gorton is a professor of the practice and the director of mobility programs in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, based in Seattle.
Gorton is passionate about analyzing and designing complex, high-performance distributed systems, and strives to instill design and architecture principles in methods and tools that can be exploited by architects for other projects. Before joining Northeastern in 2015, he was a senior member of the technical staff at the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. There, he designed massively scalable software architectures for big data applications and built knowledge bases — both manually and using machine learning — to support engineering tasks.
Before that, Gorton was a laboratory fellow in computational sciences and math at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). He managed PNNL's Data Intensive Scientific Computing research group and was the chief architect for the lab's Data Intensive Computing Initiative. He was also a principal investigator for multiple projects in environmental modeling, carbon capture and sequestration, and bioinformatics. This experience has led to his interest in the design of large-scale, highly customizable cyber-infrastructures for scientific research.
